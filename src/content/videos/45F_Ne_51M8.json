  "description": "In this how to we are going to look how you can use the different navigation system in the Aerosoft DHC-6 Twin Otter. Prior to departing I will show you how you can find both VOR's and NDB's easily using the navigation systems onboard. After that we will setup the correct frequencies in the different systems and go airborn. Once we are airborn we start using the different instruments and look at how they are acting on different situations.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
