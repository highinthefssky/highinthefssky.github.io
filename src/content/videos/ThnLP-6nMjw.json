  "description": "In this how to we are going to look at how to manage the engine of a Beechcraft Bonanza G36. First we will go through the checklist prior to starting the engine and once we are ready to start the engine we will discuss the RPM max and fuel mixture and the effects it has on the engine. Once we discussed both we continue with the cowl flaps. Once we are ready with the explanation we will start the engines and use the tug to push us back to the start of runway 27. We are doing some pre take off checks and take off from the airport. Once we are air born we will look at the effect of using the RPM max and fuel mixture and why you should use them.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
