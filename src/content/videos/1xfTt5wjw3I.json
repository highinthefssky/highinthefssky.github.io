  "description": "Welcome to this beginner’s guide to the TBM 930 in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020! In this video, we'll take you through the basics of your first flight with the TBM 930, one of the most popular turboprops in the game. You'll learn how to start the aircraft from cold and dark, taxi to the runway, 🛫 take off and ✈️ cruise. \n\n🛬Initially I also had the plan to add the landing but due to the length of the video I decided to leave that out for now. But keep an eye on my channel because I will definitely post one about landing with this aircraft.\n\nIf you're new to Microsoft Flight Simulator or flying the TBM 930, this step-by-step tutorial will get you in the air with confidence.
