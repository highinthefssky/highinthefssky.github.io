  "description": "Earlier this week World Update VIII has been released which has the focus on Portugal and Spain. Based on one of my followers feedback I found out that WU 8 was only partially (although the marketplace showed it as installed). After reinstalling the WU I indeed have more POI's including the bridges I was missing in the previous video. Based on this I decided to create a new video now with all POI's included.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #4K #Xbox #XboxseriesX",
