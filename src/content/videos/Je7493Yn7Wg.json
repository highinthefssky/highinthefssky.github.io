  "description": "In this video we will look at the news about Sim Update 10 and World Update 11 which has been revealed yesterday during the dev Q&A session. The most important news is that Sim Update 10 will be delayed. I think this is a brace step from Asobo but it also shows they listen to the feedback of the beta users. Besides the \"bad\" news there was also new about World Update 11. World Update 11 will take place in Canada and in this video you will find some screenshots of POI's and airports included.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
