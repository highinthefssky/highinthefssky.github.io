  "description": "Asobo has released Sim Update VI today. As part of the update multiple POI's are colored in Windows 11 blue to celebrate the release of the new OS from Microsoft. In this video we are going to search for those buildings while flying over Paris. For some reason not all buildings are colored as it looks like this is cause by the 3rd party addons which are overwriting the default Asobo content.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #Xbox",
