  "description": "As you might have find out already PMDG decided to include multiple vehicles as part of their Boeing 737-700 including a pushback truck. This is really nice and shows how much time is being performed on creating a high quality aircraft but there is one issue ... The default pushback truck is still in place which results in weird scenarios. Based on this I checked the PMDG forum and found a solution posted by Wonderboy:\n\nhttps://forum.pmdg.com/forum/main-forum/pmdg-737-for-msfs/186117-guide-how-remove-default-asobo-pushback-truck\n\nSo all credits for Wonderboy for coming with this solution. In this video I will show you what you need to change and the results of that change.\n\nIf you also want to give the aircraft a try you can download it from the site below:\nhttps://pmdg.com/pmdg-737-700-for-microsoft-flight-simulator/\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
