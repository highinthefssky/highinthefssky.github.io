  "description": "In this video I will fly from Sønderborg Airport to Billund  Airport. Sønderborg Airport is a small part of the Southern part of Denmark. We will fly in the East direction in the direction of Hans Christian Andersen Airport and will continue our trip to Billund. After configuring the approach we will make a bit of a de tour flying a bit back and will follow the STAR for ILS 27Y. The weather during this flight is pretty nice not to many clouds.\n\nThe aircraft used during this flight is the PMDG DC6B with the Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) livery.\n\nThis video is a hyperlapse which means the video which normally was approximately 45 minutes has been shorted to approximately 3,5 minutes. The audio of the game is removed completely and as a replacement music has been added.\n\nThe software I used to create the hyperlapse is Microsoft Hyperlapse Pro. More information about the tool can be found on the site below:\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/computational-photography-applications/microsoft-hyperlapse-pro/\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/31twppJ\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
