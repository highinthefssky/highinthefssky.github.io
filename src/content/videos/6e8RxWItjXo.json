  "description": "In this video, we'll explore the latest additions to the MSFS 2020 marketplace. This week, there's a treasure trove for general aviation enthusiasts with multiple aircrafts joining the marketplace. The exciting part? Two of these new aircrafts come as a bundle, offering an attractive discount.\n\nIn addition to the aircrafts, a handful of airports have been updated, and several mission packs have been launched for both small aircrafts and larger airliners.\n\nFor those who are fans of history, there's more good news. Alongside the release of an \"older\" aircraft, several packs have been introduced that will transport you back to the year 1935.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
