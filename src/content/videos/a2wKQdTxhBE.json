Afonso Henriques Statue\n- Church of São Miguel do Castelo\n- Aqui Nasceu Portugal Wall\n- Penha Church\n- Pope Pio IX Statue\n- Mumadona Statue\n- Citania de Briteiros \n- Teleferico (Static)\n- Campo da Feira Gardens\n- Hotel Fundador\n- Vila Verde Eucaliptus Tree\n\nIf you would like to try the scenery yourself, download it via the link below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/30734/guimaraes-portugal-landmarks\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
