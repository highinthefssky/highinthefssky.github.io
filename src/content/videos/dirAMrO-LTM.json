  "description": "In this video we will look at version 0.1 of the Sukhoi Superjet 100. The aircraft is in in early development stages and is converted from FSX. Currently their are some compatibility issues with the A32NX addon developer and experimental versions so keep that in mind. Look at the starting point the aircraft looks really nice and you can fly pretty easy with it. There is still some work to do to optimize several things to make it look nicer and more realistic but I expect that will be done as part of the new version being released in the future.\n\nIf you also want to give the aircraft a try you can download it from the site below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/15864/sukhoi-superjet-100\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
