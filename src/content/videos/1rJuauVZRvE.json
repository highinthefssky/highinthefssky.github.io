  "description": "In this how to we are going to look how we can use the rejected take off functionality of two large airliners: Boeing 787 and an Airbus A320. We will start with looking at how to configure this functionality in the airplane and will continue with a demo. After this we will switch to the A320 which is the A32NX version and will repeat the same.\n\nIf you also want to use the A32NX addon based on this video, you can download it from the site below:\nhttps://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
