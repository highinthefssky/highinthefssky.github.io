  "description": "In this how to we are going to look at the EA-7 Edgley Optica aircraft. The aircraft has received a nice update which now allows you to land on snow but probably the most important thing is that it is not compatible with Sim Update 5.\n\nIf you want to give the aircraft a try yourself you can download it from the site below: \nhttps://flightsim.to/file/12731/ea-7-edgley-optica\n\nKeep in mind that if you want to use it with the GTN750 you will need to download a copy from it from the site below:\nhttps://pms50.com/msfs/\n\nKeep in mind that the basic version has limited functionalities. To have the full suite of functionalities you need to buy a subscription.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
