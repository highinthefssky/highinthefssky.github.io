Following the apron's redesign in 2021, it can now accommodate up to nine civilian airliners simultaneously. Santorini stands out as one of the few Cyclades Islands that boasts a significant airport.\n\nFor a full overview of items added to the marketplace this week have a look at the video below:\nhttps://youtu.be/68N4Mm-u8bg\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: http://bit.ly/3qyiKXW\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #Shorts",
