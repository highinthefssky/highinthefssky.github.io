  "description": "In this addon spotlight we will have a look at a new aircraft which has been released by one of the community members for MSFS 2020: the Grumman Goose G21A Redux II. The aircraft can land on both land and water which makes it a really interesting aircraft. After having a look from both the inside and outside we take the aircraft out for a ride where we will have a look at how to control the aircraft including using the autopilot. After flying around for a while we land on the water to see how this functionality works. \n\nIf you want to also add this aircraft to your MSFS 2020 installation than download it via the link below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/19718/grumman-goose-g21a-redux-ii\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
