  "description": "Based on my earlier video this week I decided to create the same one for the Boeing 787. In this video we will reconfigure our flight plan by first deleting it partially and after that add the flight plan but using airways. This will reduce the flight plan from 6 to 3 pages in this case and will save you a lot of time entering it in the FMC.\n\n- how to delete a flight plan\n- how to use airways in a flight plan\n\n00:00 intro\n00:10 deleting the flight plan\n04:11 using airways\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nHow to spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/49LlxEU\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
