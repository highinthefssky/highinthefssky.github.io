  "description": "In this video we will have a look at the autopilot functionality as well as some of the avionics in the H-4 Hercules spruce goose. Initially this aircraft didn't had this functionality but with Sim Update 12 the aircraft will get this functionality which now makes it possible to use modern avionics systems in an older aircraft.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
