  "description": "Southern Illinois Airport is a public airport situated in Jackson County. It lies three nautical miles northwest of Carbondale's central business district and to the east of Murphysboro. The airport is part of the FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2021–2025, where it is classified as a general aviation facility.\n\nThe recent updates have introduced several static scenery objects to the airport, enhancing its realism significantly. Moreover, the renovated terminal building is sure to impress with its improvements.\n\nFor a full overview of items added to the marketplace this week have a look at the video below:\nhttps://youtu.be/vNKBY9nTXz4\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: http://bit.ly/3qyiKXW\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #Shorts",
