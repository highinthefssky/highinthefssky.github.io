  "description": "In this video we will have a look at how to modify the sensitivity in the Reno Air Races pre-release testing version. As it is based on MSFS 2020 you will see that it works pretty much the same. So if you are used to modifying controller settings in MSFS 2020 this should look pretty familiar. After modifying the settings we will see what the effect is on one of the aircraft during a qualification for one of the races.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon Reno Air Race playlist: https://bit.ly/3Cbmc0T\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #Xbox #4K",
