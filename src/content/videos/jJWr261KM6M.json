  "description": "In this video I will show you the Air Creation 582SL ultralight trike which some of you might remember from FSX timeframes. The airplane is based on the FSX version and is converted to MSFS 2020. The airplane is still in development but most pieces are working so you can already enjoy flying with it through the nice scenery included in MSFS 2020.\n\nIf you want to try the aircraft yourself please download it from the site below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/13218/air-creation-582sl\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
