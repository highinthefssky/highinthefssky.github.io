  "description": "In this video we are going to look at \"Vessels: The Channel Islands\" release by Seafront Simulations. This addon adds multiple vessels around the islands Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney, Herm and Sark. For those who are already using MSFS 2020 a little but longer it should be no surprise that the default vessels are not always correctly being displayed. Using this update you will see multiple types of vessels around the islands which is a nice improvement compares to the default vessels.\nSeafront Simulations is offering the update for free so visit the link below and get your copy:\n\nhttps://seafrontsims.com/\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: http://bit.ly/3qyiKXW\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
