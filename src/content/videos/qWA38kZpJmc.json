  "title": "Flight Simulator 2020  -  How to - Change cockpit buttons behavior to prior Sim Update 5",
  "description": "Prior to Sim Update 5 the buttons on the dashboards did not illuminate and buttons could be controlled pretty easy. With Sim Update 5 this has changed to ensure a universal method of controlling those buttons however currently not all community addons don't fully support this method and maybe you even liked the previous method even more ;-). In this video we will discuss how you can revert this configuration and control the buttons the \"old\" way.\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
