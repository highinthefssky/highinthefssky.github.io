  "description": "In this video we will look at the Tauranga region airport which is now available in the MSFS marketplace. Although seeing the title might make you think you will get one airport based on the description in the marketplace it looks like you get multiple airports on the Northern part of New Zealand. So if you love flying in New Zealand this might be a package which you want to buy.\n\nFor a full overview of items added to the marketplace this week have a look at the video below:\nhttps://youtu.be/EPCdjGHVRsY\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: http://bit.ly/3qyiKXW\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #Shorts",
