  "description": "Did you know the Douglas DC6 has a giropilot/autopilot? In this video we will have a look how to use the functionalities offered by the giropilot to  climb/decent and keep a specific altitude. In addition we are going to look at how we can change the direction of the airplane and even use the GPS to follow our flight plan and eventually land.\n\nWe depart from Murmansk airport runway 31 and will land on the same runway after making a short flight.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
