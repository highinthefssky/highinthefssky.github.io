  "description": "In this video we will have a look at Olympia (Washington) which received a photogrammetry update as part of World Update X which was released already 2 weeks ago. The city itself is located closely to several lakes and to two is located pretty close to Tacoma and Seattle. We will depart from Olympia regional airport which is at the border of the city and fly multiple times over the city and see if we can recognize some spots.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
