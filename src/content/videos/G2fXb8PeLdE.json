  "description": "🔍 Description\n🚀It’s too much to describe, so I recommend watching the video. This week saw a massive release of airports and scenery packages, possibly the largest number ever in a single week. Airports from major vendors like Inibuilds and ORBX, as well as newer developers such as Prealsoft, have launched new content. It seems more developers are now embracing the leap to MSFS 2024. Additionally, several packages adding numerous POIs to cities like Casablanca, Amsterdam, and Rome have been introduced.\n\n📹 Other marketplace additions\nIf you are looking for either the new training missions or new aircrafts and liveries review the respective video by clicking on one if the links below:\n\n- New activities: https://youtu.be/evPra_D9wNk\n- New aircraft & stunning liveries: https://youtu.be/oXFwvUmoTZ8\n\n🔔 Subscribe\n If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP\n\n🔗Other related links\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSim #FlightSimulator2024 #fs2024",
