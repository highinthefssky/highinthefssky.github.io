  "description": "In this video we will have a look at the Dornier Do 31. We start with reviewing the aircraft in the gallery and look at the failures and multiple liveries which are included. Once that is completed we do a full review of the exterior and interior of the aircraft. Last but not least we start the aircraft by following the checklist to check the sounds of the aircraft and of course the visual changes.\n\n0:00 intro\n0:10 aircraft basics and liveries\n2:41 exterior review\n8:48 interior review\n10:30 cockpit review\n15:30 starting the aircraft\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
