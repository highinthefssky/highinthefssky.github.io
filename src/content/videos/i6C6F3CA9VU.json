  "description": "This is the second quiz which on my channel. \nI changed the plans a bit and decided to post a quiz on Mondays and one on Fridays. The answer for Mondays video is the point we start with in this video and after that we will continue with a new quiz. I made this one a bit easier because I think the previous one might have been a bit to complicated.\n\nTo know what the question is simply watch the video and post your answer below the video. \n\nDISCLAIMER: you cannot win anything except the honor ;-)\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nQuiz playlist: http://bit.ly/3iwJy8g\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
