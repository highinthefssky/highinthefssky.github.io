  "description": "In this video we will look at the Luxembourg city addon which has been released yesterday. My first impression of the addon is that it really adds value and the developer added a lot of details while also keeping in mind the performance. We will take of from Luxembourg airport and fly over the city multiple times also visiting the POI's which are part of the city.\n\nIf you also want to give the scenery updates a try download your own copy using the link below:\n\nLuxembourg city:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/18226/luxembourg-city\n\nLuxembourg airport:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/12973/luxemburg-airport\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
