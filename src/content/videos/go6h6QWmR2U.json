  "description": "Yesterday Asobo released a hotfix for Sim Update 5 which was released last week.

The good thing Asobo is really listening to the community and took corrective actions. \n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
