  "description": "In this video we will look at the Garmin G1000 NXi version 0.10.1 which has been released yesterday. Keep in mind it is still work in progress and is not compatible with the Working Title G1000. If you want to use the G1000 NXi you should remove the Working Title G1000 first.\n\nIn this update a lot of modifications are made to the MFD but also to the PFD which are really nice. In this video we will review most of the new features and show you how to use them.\n\nIf you also want to give the G1000 NXi a try visit the marketplace inside MSFS 2020 and download your own copy.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
