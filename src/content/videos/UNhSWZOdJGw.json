  "description": "🔍 Description\n🚀Only two new items have been added, but one is especially exciting: the Chinook CH47D from MSFS 2024, now backported to MSFS 2020. You can enjoy its various configurations while flying the helicopter with one of the five included liveries. If you’d rather fly something that doesn’t exist in the real world, try the Quasar from Flying Fries. This supersonic aircraft boasts an incredibly high maximum altitude and blistering supersonic speed. 🌍🛫\n\n📹 Other marketplace additions\nIf you are looking for either the new training missions or new enhanced scenery and enhanced airports review the respective video by clicking on one if the links below:\n\n- New activities: https://youtu.be/A78dfFPyLas\n- New enhanced scenery and airports: https://youtu.be/vmsYCGGyvUI\n\n🔔 Subscribe\n If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP\n\n🔗Other related links\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
