  "description": "Could you trust an AI to teach you how to fly? I decided to find out! In this video, I'm doing a crazy experiment inside Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024: I'm attempting to start my Cessna 172 G1000 and take-off and use Microsoft Copilot as my one and only instructor, using its brand-new *Vision Mode*.\n\nSo, what is this tech? *Microsoft Copilot* is an AI assistant, and the new *Vision Mode* gives it eyes 👁️. It can analyze my screen in real-time, meaning I can ask it questions about my instruments, flight plan, or what a specific button does, just like a real co-pilot.\n\nI'll be starting the aircraft, taking off, using the autopilot and try to configure a flight plan relying solely on the AI's instructions. Will it lead me to a perfectly being able to perform all steps, or will it be a total disaster? This could be the most futuristic or the most chaotic flight I've ever had. Buckle up! ✈️\n\n📖 Chapters\n00:00 - intro\n00:23 - intro video\n00:46 - installing and configuring Microsoft Copilot\n02:25 - enabling and using Vision mode\n23:33 - conclusion and outro\n24:26 - outro video\n\n⬇️ What are your thoughts on using this new functionality as you AI assistant in MSFS 2024?\n\n👍 If you found this video helpful, please give it a like and subscribe for more MSFS 2024 updates and tips\n\n🔗 Access the full release notes: https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/sim-update-3-beta-1-5-16-0-release-notes-july-11th-2025/729371\n\n🔗Other related links\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#MSFS2024 #FlightSimulator #Update #beta #flightsimulator2024",
