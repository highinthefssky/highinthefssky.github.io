  "description": "In this how to we are going to look how we can configure our flight plan manually in our navigation system from our Boeing 787. In this video we will use the B78XH mod which adds a lot of additional functionality to the cockpit compared to the default Boeing 787 provided by Asobo. \n\nRoute being configure will be from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (EHAM)\n(LPPT) to John F. Kennedy Airport (KJFK). \n\nWe won't program the whole flight but just a few waypoints and in addition to this we will have a look at how your can add a SID and STAR to your flight plan.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
