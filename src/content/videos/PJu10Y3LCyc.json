  "description": "In this video I will fly from Brussel to Innsbruck. This video is a hyperlapse which means the video which normally was over 2 hours has been shorted to approximately 3 minutes. The hyperlapse will result in video to be removed completely so don't expect me explaining something.\n\nThe software I used to create the hyperlapse is Microsft Hyperlapse Pro. More information about the tool can be found on the site below:\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/computational-photography-applications/microsoft-hyperlapse-pro/\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/31twppJ\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
