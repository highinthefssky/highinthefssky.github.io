  "description": "Maybe you have seen the movie White House Down I personally think the scenes where Marine One fly's very low over the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool from Lincoln Memorial via the Washington Monument to the White House.\n\nI changed the scene a bit and instead of flying to the White House I am flying in the direction of the United States Capitol. During this flight I am using an Airbus H135 due to the fact that the Sikorsky S-92 which is normally used as Marine One is not available for MSFS 2020.\n\nIf you also want to give the helicopter a try download the  Airbus H135 from the site below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/discover/helicopter\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/31twppJ\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
