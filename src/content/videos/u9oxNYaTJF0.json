  "description": "🔍 Description\n🚀This week, there aren’t too many new items in the marketplace—just three new aircraft, all from Captain Sim: the C-130E Hercules, the Boeing 767-300ER GE, and the Boeing 777-200/200ER RR. So, it’s a choice between an older military plane or one of the larger airliners.🌍🛫\n\n📹 Other marketplace additions\nIf you are looking for either the new training missions or new enhanced scenery and enhanced airports review the respective video by clicking on one if the links below:\n\n- New enhanced scenery and airports: https://youtu.be/-eA33aZjdE4\n- New activities: no new items\n\n🔔 Subscribe\n If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP\n\n🔗Other related links\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2024 #FlightSim #FS2024",
