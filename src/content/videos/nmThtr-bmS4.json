  "description": "In this video I will show you how I approached the Arlanda landing challenge which has been added to MSFS 2020 as part of World Update V. Out of 3 the 2nd try was the best one but still I didn't pass my original high score so some more practice to do.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP🔔 \n\nLive events playlist: https://bit.ly/2Yfagtl\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
