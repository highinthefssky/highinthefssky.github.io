  "description": "In this video we will look at this weeks addition to the marketplace for MSFS 2020. This week I think we almost hit a record: 53 new items have been added to the marketplace. The updates include both livery packs, scenery enhancement, missions packs and update airports. Unfortunately no new aircrafts have been added.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
