  "description": "In this video we will have a look at SoFly's Landing Challenge Pro which has been released earlier today. The addon adds 30 new landing challenges to MSFS 2020 in all categories: famous, epic and strong wind. But within these categories SoFly made difference based on difficulty. The additional layer which has been added allows you to start with the easy landing challenges and continue with the tough and pro one's later on.\n\nThe addon can be bought either via SoFly directly or via ORBX.
