  "description": "In this video we will look at the Lockheed Harpoon PV2 which has been released earlier today. The aircraft is ported from FSX and still has some issues like most  FSX ported aircrafts which will hopefully be fixed in the future. The good thing is you can fly with it although you cannot start completely from scratch at this moment. \n\nIf you also want to give this aircraft a try download your own copy from:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/22742/lockheed-harpoon-pv-2\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
