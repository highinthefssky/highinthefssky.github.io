  "description": "In this video we will look at the Garmin G1000 NXi version 0.6.0 which has been released a few days ago. Keep in mind it is still work in progress and is not compatible with the Working Title G1000. If you want to use the G1000 NXi you should remove the Working Title G1000 first.\n\nThis is the second update the addon is receiving and it will both bring some new features and fixes some issues which did occur in the previous version(s).\n\nIf you also want to give the G1000 NXi a try visit the marketplace inside MSFS 2020 and download your own copy.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
