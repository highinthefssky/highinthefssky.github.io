  "description": "In this video we will fly under the Vizcaya Bridge . The Vizcaya Bridge (Bizkaiko Zubia in Basque, Puente de Vizcaya in Spanish) is a transporter bridge that links the towns of Portugalete and Las Arenas (part of Getxo) in the Biscay province of Spain, crossing the mouth of the Nervion River.\n\nPeople in the area, and even the official website, commonly call it the Puente Colgante (literally \"hanging bridge\", used for suspension bridge in Spanish), although its structure is quite different from a suspension bridge\n\nIt has been declared a Natural Monument by the regional Ministry for the Environment of the Xunta de Galicia.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nPOI playlist: https://bit.ly/3OX9zwv\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #shorts",
