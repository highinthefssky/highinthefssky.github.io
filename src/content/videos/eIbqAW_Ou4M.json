  "description": "One of the things which is known from the Netherlands are the large infrastructures to protect the country against the water. \n\nIn this cinematic movie we will make a short flight in the province of Zeeland following the Oosterscheldekering. The Oosterscheldekering is part of the Delta works and is the longest dam build as part of the Delta works project. The dam was officially opened in 1984 and has moving parts which can be close in case of  heavy storms to protect the country behind the dam.\n\nIn this video a community addon has been used to show the actual Oosterscheldering.
