This update is focusing mostly in the virtual cockpit and a small number of system behavior issues which were both uncovered by simmers and PMDG. The good thing is they continue to optimize this aircraft and every update it is getting better and better.\n\nIf you also want to give the aircraft a try you can download it from the site below:\nhttps://pmdg.com/pmdg-737-700-for-microsoft-flight-simulator/\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
