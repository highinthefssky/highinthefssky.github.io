  "description": "In this video, we will explore the unexpected update released yesterday. This update includes the latest AIRAC cycle which is kind of normal that it is updated on a regular basis. But this update also included some airports which have been updated by the community by submitting updated using the World Hub tool: which is still in beta.\n\nHowever there is another thing which has changed on file level which is not mentioned anywhere. It likely has to do with the AI airplanes in MSFS. Multiple files in a folder called fs-base-ai-traffic are also updated. In this video we will have a look at one of the readable files to see if we can figure out what this folder is used for.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
