  "description": "In this video we will look at the Robinson R44 Raven II helicopter. The helicopter itself is known already by a lot of simmers since it has been around already for a while. However this new version has a huge advantage, it is using the new helicopter flight dynamics which are part of the 40th anniversary edition. I think this results in this is currently the only community addon heli which has this huge advantage.\n\nIf you want to give the helicopter a try download it via the link below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/45703/robinson-r44-raven-ii-helicopter-40th-anniversary-edition\n\nAlso make sure you installed PMS50's GTN 750 if you didn't install it yet:\nhttps://pms50.com/msfs/\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
