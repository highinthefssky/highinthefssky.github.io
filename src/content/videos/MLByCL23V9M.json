  "description": "In this video we are going to have a look at the first Famous Flyer released by Asobo for MSFS 2020: the Beechcraft 17. After a short review of the various liveries we will take the aircraft out for a flight but not before we inspected both the interior and exterior of it. Once that is completed we go airborn and perform a short flight.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
