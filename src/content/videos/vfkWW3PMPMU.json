  "description": "What's the best way to play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 for peak performance? Is it better to download all the content or rely on streaming? I decided to put it to the test! In this video, I perform a comprehensive performance test to find out if having the content stored on your hard drive really makes a difference.\n\nI ran a series of identical flights and tests using two separate installations: one with all scenery and assets downloaded, and another using only the streamed content.\n\n⏱️Test 1: How quickly does the sim launch from the desktop?\n⏱️Test 2: A true test of patience: loading a complex aircraft at JFK Airport.\n📊Test 3: The ultimate stress test—a smooth flyover of the detailed NYC skyline to see which setup handles it best.\n\nQuick breakdown of the two methods:\n\n💾Downloaded: Data is already on your PC, which theoretically should lead  to faster load times and fewer stutters, but consumes a lot of SSD/HDD space.\n\n☁️Streamed: Data is pulled from Microsoft's servers as you fly, saving space but potentially introducing performance issues if your internet connection is slow or inconsistent.\n\nThe results might change how you play the sim. Watch to the end to see which one came out on top! 📈\n\n🖥️System specs\nAMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D\n64GB Memory DDR5 6000MHz\nGigabyte RTX 4090 Gaming OC\nSamsung SSD 900 Pro 2TB\n\nNo overclocking configured\n\n🌍Internet speed\n1GB up/down fiber\n\nDo you have a preferred method?
