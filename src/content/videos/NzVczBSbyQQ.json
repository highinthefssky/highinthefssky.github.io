  "title": "Land on a very challenging updated airport in Columbia: Matecaña International Airport",
  "description": "Matecaña International Airport (Spanish: Aeropuerto Internacional de Matecaña, IATA: PEI, ICAO: SKPE) serves the city of Pereira, Colombia, and acts as an alternate airport for Armenia, Cartago, Manizales, Medellín, Cali, and Bogotá. \n\nPositioned on the brink of a deep ravine, the airport is located 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) west of Pereira, with steep drop-offs surrounding the runway and high terrain encompassing all quadrants except the south.\n\nApproaching this airport presents a notable challenge due to the significant elevation difference between the runway's end and the surrounding area. Nevertheless, upon landing, visitors can appreciate the intricately detailed terminal interior and the static display of scenery objects in the hangar. For an added experience, a nighttime landing showcases the airport's enhanced lighting system.\n\nFor a full overview of items added to the marketplace this week have a look at the video below:\nhttps://youtu.be/vNKBY9nTXz4\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: http://bit.ly/3qyiKXW\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #Shorts",
