  "description": "In this video we will have a look at the Ford 4-AT Trimotor which has been released yesterday. It is the 6th Famous flyer which is released by Asobo and Microsoft for MSFS 2020. The good new is that it is available for FREE for a limited period. So go to the marketplace and make sure you \"buy\" it before the 1st of July because from the 1st of July onwards you need to pay a small amount of money for the aircraft.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
