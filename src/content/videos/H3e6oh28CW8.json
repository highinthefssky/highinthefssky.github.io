The Zentrum Paul Klee is a museum dedicated to the artist Paul Klee, located in Bern, Switzerland and designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano. It features about 40 percent of Paul Klee’s entire pictorial oeuvre.\n\nIn 1997, Livia Klee-Meyer, Paul Klee's daughter-in-law, donated her inheritance of almost 690 works to the city and canton of Bern.[1] Additional works and documents donated and loaned by the family and the Paul-Klee-Foundation and a further 200 on loans. from private collections contributed to creating a very large collection of works by the artist. The decision to build the museum in the Schöngrün site on the eastern outskirts of the city was made in 1998, and renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano was contracted the same year. A preliminary project was elaborated in 2000. The building was completed in 2005. It takes the form of three undulations blending into the landscape.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nPOI playlist: https://bit.ly/3OX9zwv\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #shorts",
