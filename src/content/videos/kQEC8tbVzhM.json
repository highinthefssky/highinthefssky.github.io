  "description": "In this video we will have a look at San Diego which received a photogrammetry update as part of World Update X which was released already 2 weeks ago. This time we will fly over the city center which received a bigger update compared to the pieces outside of the city center. If you like navy vessels I have some good news for you because you will find a lot of them in the harbor close to the city.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
