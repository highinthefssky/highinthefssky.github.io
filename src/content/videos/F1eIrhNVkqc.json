  "description": "In this how to we are going to look at how to load a flight plan created using the build-in flight planner from MSFS 2020 in the Flight Management System (FMS) in a CJ4 with the Working Title CJ4 addon installed. The addons adds some great functionality like calculating the ideal take off and landing speed which is pretty handy. We will first look at how to perform some basic tasks in the CJ4 before we will load the flight plan itself. After we did load the flight plan we will have a quick look at how to program the performance relate settings which has the nice option to automatically calculate the V-speeds for you.\n\nWorking Title CJ4 can be downloaded from this site: https://github.com/Working-Title-MSFS-Mods/fspackages\n\nThe V abbreviations can be found on the site below:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_speeds\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
