In this video we will fly over Bilbao to see the photogrammetry updated content which has been added to the city. Unfortunately the city didn't receive any POI's like other cities in this World Update (at least they are not marked on the map but according to the release notes it should have ;-))\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #4K #Xbox #XboxseriesX",
