  "description": "It has been released: World Update VII Australia. In this video we will do our first flight above Sydney just after the update has been released. Comparing it with before the world update I already see a lot of enhancement so I am pretty enthusiastic. I am not living in Sydney so I can't tell you if it is realistic. If you are living there feel free to leave a comment in the comment box to let us know how realistic it is.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
