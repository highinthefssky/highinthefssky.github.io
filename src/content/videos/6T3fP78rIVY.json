  "description": "In this video we will look at version 1.0 of the  Fleet Aircraft 50K which is currently in beta. The aircraft has a lot of potential but there is still a lot of work to do. Graphically it all looks really nice but the buttons inside the aircraft are not working and the only way to control the aircraft including starting it is by using the keyboard or joystick\n\nIf you also want to give the aircraft a try you can download it from the site below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/17074/fleet-aircraft-50k-tundra-cargo-w-original-cockpit-panel\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
