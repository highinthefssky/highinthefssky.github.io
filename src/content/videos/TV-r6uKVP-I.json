  "description": "In this video I will show you how I approached the Celebrity into Bora Bora landing challenge and landed successfully on the runway. The first and second try were both pretty OK although there was some room for improvement which I tried to make in the third and fourth try. However both of them were not so successful so I need to practice a bit more on my landing skills.  the Keep in mind that this landing challenge is not part of the default MSFS 2020 installation but requires you to have the Landing Challenge Pro software from SoFly.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP🔔 \n\nLive events playlist: https://bit.ly/2Yfagtl\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #LandingChallengePro",
