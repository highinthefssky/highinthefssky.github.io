  "description": "In this video we will fly over the city of Albany which is located on the West Coast of the US close to Portland and above the city of Eugene which we reviewed earlier. We will start at a small airport outside of the city and do a flyover over the airport before we will have a look at the city itself. While flying over the city we will look at the photogrammetry content which has been added as part of World Update X.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
