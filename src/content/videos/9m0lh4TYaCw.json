  "description": "🔍 Description\n🚀Check out the latest updates in Microsoft Flight Simulator! This week, new airports have been added, ranging from the dirt runways of Shady Cove Airpark to the updated Saint Helena Airport and regional U.S. airports like Casper Natrona, Cheyenne Regional, and Brunswick Golden Isles. There's likely an airport to suit every simmer's preference. Additionally, several scenery enhancements have been introduced to improve lighting, but the highlight for me is the Tromso City landmarks, which let you virtually explore the city of Tromso. Don’t miss these amazing improvements!!\n\n📹 Other marketplace additions\nIf you are looking for either the new training missions or new aircrafts and liveries review the respective video by clicking on one if the links below:\n\n- New activities: https://youtu.be/FPX6hW0kN9E\n- New aircraft & stunning liveries: https://youtu.be/JK7yz2ajgho\n\n🔔 Subscribe\n If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP\n\n🔗Other related links\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSim #FlightSimulator2024 #fs2024",
