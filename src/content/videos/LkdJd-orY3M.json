  "description": "In this video we will review a glider: the Waco CG 4A. This glider can transport both troops as well as a jeep. The good new is that this also the case in MSFS. The aircraft has a nose which can be opened a little bit like the Antonov AN225 however in this case the cockpit is completely moved away. The Waco can be pulled into the air either using the default Cessna 172 or one of the 3 other systems available in MSFS. However with the Douglas C-47D also added to MSFS you can use this aircraft to help getting airborne. After we looked at the liveries and failures we will review exterior, interior, and cockpit. Finally, we'll guide you on where to find the manual, which is filled with fascinating details.\n\n0:00 intro\n0:10 aircraft basics and liveries\n3:04 exterior review\n6:03 interior review\n6:49 cockpit review\n10:51 where to find the manual\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
