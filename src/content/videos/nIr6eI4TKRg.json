  "description": "Today Asobo released Sim Update V. As part of this Sim Update also a new aircraft became available. The Orbis Flying Eye Hospital which is a MacDonell Douglas MD10. If you are getting really exited I must disappoint you. Although the aircraft has been added it cannot fly. If this will happen someone in the future that is still a secret I think ;-)\n\nIn this video I will show you how you can get the aircraft so you can have a look how the flying eye hospital looks from the inside.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
