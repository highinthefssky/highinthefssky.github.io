  "description": "Today 80 years ago it was D-Day. Microsoft and Asobo decided to honor this day by releasing an airplane bundle which includes two aircrafts which were heavily used in that time: Douglas C-47D skytrain and the WACO CG 4A. The C-47D is based on the DC-3 from Douglas but was specifically developed as a military aircraft. The WACO CG 4A is a special glider which can be pulled in the air using the Douglas C-47D. However it is not a normal flyer because it can both be used to transport people as well as cargo.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
