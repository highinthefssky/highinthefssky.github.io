  "description": "In this how to we are going to look how we can configure our flight plan manually in our navigation system using the Garmin G1000 NXi. We will first plan our flight using Simbrief and after figuring out how we are going to fly to our destination will will program it in the G1000 NXi. Once programmed we will look at how to set a Standard Instrumental Departure (SID) and Standard Terminal Approach Route (STAR). As bonus we will look at how to set a direct route to a waypoint/airport/\n\nRoute being configure will be from Trapani–Birgi Airport (LICT) to Reggio di Calabria \"Tito Minniti\" Airport (LICR) initially. \n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
