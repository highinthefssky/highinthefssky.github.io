  "description": "In this video we will fly over the Jasmund National Park. The Jasmund National Park (German: Nationalpark Jasmund) is a nature reserve on the Jasmund peninsula, in the northeast of Rügen island in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. It is famous for containing the largest chalk cliffs in Germany, the Königsstuhl (German = \"king's chair\"). These cliffs are up to 161 m (528 ft) above the Baltic Sea. The beech forests behind the cliffs are also part of the national park.\n\nConsisting of only 30 km2 (12 sq mi), this is the smallest national park in Germany. The park was founded in 1990 by the last government of East Germany (GDR) prior to the German reunification.\n\nOn June 25, 2011, the beech forest in the park was added to UNESCO World Heritage Site as an extension of the Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and the Ancient Beech Forests of Germany.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nPOI playlist: https://bit.ly/3OX9zwv\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #shorts",
