  "description": "In this video we will fly under all three Tallberg Bridges. The Tallberg Bridges (Tallbergsbroarna in Swedish) consist of three railway bridges that cross the Öre River at Slätforsen, about 4 km from Nyåker, Nordmaling Municipality in Sweden. They are part of the Northern Main Line through upper Norrland. One of the bridges has been rebuilt for road traffic. The three bridges show how bridge construction has changed over the course of a century.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nPOI playlist: https://bit.ly/3OX9zwv\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #shorts",
