  "description": "Sim Update 4 is the \"performance beta\" we've been waiting for, and the 2D gains are REAL. But this performance came at a cost.\n\nJoin me for a full brain dump as I review the \"secret sauce\" behind the new speed and the big community-requested fixes (goodbye, blurry night lighting!).\n\n\nBut we'll also dive into the \"other side of the coin\":\n\n- The \"fundamentally broken\" VR experience \n- The un-fixed mouse cursor bug \n- The addon \"minefield\" that's crashing complex planes \n- New features like Helicopter VRS Protection \n\nIs the performance boost worth the instability? This video will help you decide.\n\n👉 Let me know your decision in the comments: Are you updating or waiting? Thanks for watching!\n\n👍 If you found this video helpful, please give it a like and subscribe for more MSFS 2024 updates and tips\n\n🔗 Access the full release notes: https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/sim-update-3-beta-1-5-15-0-release-notes-july-9th-2025/729049\n\n🔗Other related links\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#MSFS2024 #FlightSimulator #Update #beta #flightsimulator2024",
