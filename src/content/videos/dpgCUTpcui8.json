  "description": "In this video we will look at what has been added and what has been fixed in the first beta release for Sim Update 13 which will be released in a few weeks. The list is pretty long especially for the Boeings which is kind of expected since they also received a lot of new functionality lately. The good new is new functionalities keep coming because the list of new functionalities both both the 787 and 747 is impressive again.\nMy personal favorite however is the addition of the native Simbrief integration for multiple aircrafts.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
