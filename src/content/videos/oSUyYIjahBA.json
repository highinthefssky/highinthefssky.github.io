  "description": "In this video we will fly under the Fausto Bisantis Bridge. The Ponte Bisantis – officially Viadotto Fausto Bisantis, colloquially also Ponte Morandi – is a road bridge in Catanzaro in Calabria. When it opened in 1962, the bridge designed by Riccardo Morandi had the second largest concrete arch in the world after the Sandöbron in Sweden and is still the largest arched bridge in Italy. It is similar to the Paul Sauer Bridge in South Africa planned by Morandi some time earlier. It was named in 2002 after the politician Fausto Bisantis, who significantly influenced the decision to build the bridge in the 1950s.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nPOI playlist: https://bit.ly/3OX9zwv\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #shorts",
