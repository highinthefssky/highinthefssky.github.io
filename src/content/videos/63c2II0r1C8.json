  "description": "In this video we will have a look at the changes to the Cessna CJ4 aircraft and to the avionics inside the aircraft which received a large update as part of AAU 1. This update is still in beta but works pretty well for a beta on my machine. We will go a little bit from change to change (and sometimes back ;-)).\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
