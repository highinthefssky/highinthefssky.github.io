  "description": "In this video I will show you how I approached the Engine trouble at the gold coast landing challenge and landed successfully on the runway. The first and second try were not that successful but third time was a big improvement although there is still a lot of room for improvement. the Keep in mind that this landing challenge is not part of the default MSFS 2020 installation but requires you to have the Landing Challenge Pro software from SoFly.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP🔔 \n\nLive events playlist: https://bit.ly/2Yfagtl\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #LandingChallengePro",
