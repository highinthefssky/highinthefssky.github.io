  "description": "In this addon spotlight we are going to look at Berlin Tempelhof Airport (EDDI) version 1.0 which has been released a few days ago. This addon has been created by a community member and adds the closed airport to MSFS 2020. Berlin Tempelhof was an operational airport until 2008 after which it was converted to a public park. But in Flight Simulator 2020 everything is possible even opening an old airport. \n\nIf you want to give the airport a try yourself you can download it from the site below: \nhttps://flightsim.to/file/19112/berlin-tempelhof-airport-eddi\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
