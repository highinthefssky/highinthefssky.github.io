  "description": "In this video we will fly over the Stockhorn and follow the mountain to see multiple other mountain tops close to it. The Stockhorn is a mountain of the Bernese Alps, overlooking the region of Lake Thun in the Bernese Oberland. It is located north of the town of Erlenbach im Simmental.\n\nThe Stockhorn is 2,190 m (7,190 ft) high and is accessible via cable car from Erlenbach. It has a restaurant at the top and is a good starting point for many hikes. There is good fishing in the two lakes right below the Stockhorn, the Oberstockensee (around 1,650 m [5,410 ft] high) and the Hinterstockensee (around 1,550 m [5,090 ft] high). There is a subterranean water connection between the two lakes.\n\nFrom the top the view includes many of the surrounding Alps; the Eiger, Mönch, Jungfrau, Schreckhorn, along with the valley of the Aare river, Thun and Lake Thun, Interlaken and the Jura Mountains.\n\nIt has been declared a Natural Monument by the regional Ministry for the Environment of the Xunta de Galicia.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nPOI playlist: https://bit.ly/3OX9zwv\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #shorts",
