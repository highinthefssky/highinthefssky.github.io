  "description": "A new helicopter has been released in beta phase for MSFS 2020: the HCG Cabri G2. It is a small helicopter developed in Europe and has space for a pilot and a copilot. The helicopter is still in full development so you might see some things which are not working as you would expect them to work. If that is the case please provide this info back to the developer so they can fix it in future releases.\n\n0:00 intro\n0:10 review liveries and options\n2:49 exterior and interior review\n6:26 going air born\n\nPS I am aware of a blackpiece in the video which was caused by a render issue unfortunately.\n\nIf you also want to give the helicopter a try you can download it from the site below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/36054/hcg-cabri-g2\n\nKeep in mind this helicopter does require you to use Airland FS which can be downloaded here:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/21417/airlandfs\n\nIf you don't know how AirlandFS works have a look at this video which I created earlier about AirlandFS using a different helicopter:\nhttps://youtu.be/t58LG3-QP4s\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
