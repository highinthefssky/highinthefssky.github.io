  "description": "In this video we will look at Sim update II for Flight Simulator 2020 which has been released yesterday. We will look at the new training being added for airliners and have a look at the Christmas presents Asobo has added to this release. VR will be shortly discussed but not demo'd due to the fact of no hardware being available for testing.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
