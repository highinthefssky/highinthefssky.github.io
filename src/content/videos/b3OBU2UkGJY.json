  "description": "In this video we are going to have a look at how to use the navigation system of the Boeing 247D. The first thing you need to keep in mind that it cannot be compared with a navigation system in a modern aircraft. The second thing is that you will need to have Little Navmap to plan your flights. We will spend time on the whole process of importing the beacons in Little Navmap until really using them. If you don't have a lot of experience with Little Navmap and want to understand the basics have a look at this video which I posted a while back: https://youtu.be/1KYuA69vgNw\n\nLittle Navmap can be downloaded from the site below:\nhttps://albar965.github.io/littlenavmap.html\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
