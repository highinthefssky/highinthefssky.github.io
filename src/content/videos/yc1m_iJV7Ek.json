  "description": "In this video we will have a look at the handcrafted airport Block Island Airport (KBID). The airport is located on an islands close to New York. On the islands you will find small villages and several bays with boats in it which is nice to fly over. On the coast you will find multiple beaches and cliffs. The airport itself has one runway and is pretty small however the level of detail being added by the latest update is amazing.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
