  "description": "This week, Cairo International Airport (HECA) was updated in MSFS. As Cairo's main international airport and Egypt's largest and busiest, it functions as the primary hub for Egyptair, Nile Air, and various other airlines. Situated in Heliopolis, the airport lies northeast of Cairo, approximately fifteen kilometres (eight nautical miles) from the city's business district. The update enhances the airport's details, greatly improving the experience of using Cairo International Airport in MSFS.\n\nFor a full overview of items added to the marketplace this week have a look at the video below:\nhttps://youtu.be/Vtw4lS1I3Hg\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: http://bit.ly/3qyiKXW\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #Shorts",
