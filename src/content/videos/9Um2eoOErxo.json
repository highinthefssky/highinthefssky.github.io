  "description": "In this video we will have a look at how to use the EFB in the Airbus A320 V2 which will be part of Sim Update 14 which is currently in beta. If you are already owning an Inibuild aircraft you likely see some things which you recognize in the A320 V2. And this makes sense since Inibuilding has taken the challenge to update the A320 with a lot of cool things including the MCDU with Simbrief integration.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nHow to spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/49LlxEU\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
