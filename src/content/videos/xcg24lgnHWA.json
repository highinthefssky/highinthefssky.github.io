  "description": "In this video we will look at the Native Airbus A330-900 Neo which has been recently updated to version 0.91. The aircraft has the same cockpit as the A32NX from FBW but if you don't have the FBW version installed no problem because this aircraft has it's own copy. The downside of it is that it is not based on the latest version of the A32NX. After looking from the outside we will shortly look inside and than take off and fly a bit with the aircraft.\n\nIn the latest version the following fixes are included:\n\n- Fixed aileron animations\n- Fixed GPWS callout\n- Fixed red button on sidesticks\n- Fixed porthole views\n- Fixed pilot camera position\n- Fixed fuel data on ECAM\n- Fixed trust scale\n- Fixed wingflex scale (but maybe too much now ?)\n- Fixed bug and water effect on cockpit glass\n- Fixed C gear light\n- Fixed landing light message on ECAM\n- Fixed CG position\n- Added EFB\n- Removed the copilot inside the cockpit\n\nIf you also want to give this aircraft a try download your own copy from:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/18198/airbus-a330-900neo-conversion\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
