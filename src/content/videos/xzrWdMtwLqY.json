  "description": "🔍 Description\n🚀This week, a mix of executive and international airports has been added, along with a special pack that introduces more haze. The idea is to avoid an overly clear and unrealistic sky, so one vendor created a package to add realism by simulating haze caused by aerosols. The new airports are located in various countries, including Canada and the US.🛫\n\n📹 Other marketplace additions\nIf you are looking for either the new training missions or new enhanced scenery and enhanced airports review the respective video by clicking on one if the links below:\n\n- New activities: https://youtu.be/qtvfJZ3u8zY\n- New Aircraft & Stunning Liveries: https://youtu.be/aOa6XzrXOBg\n\n🔔 Subscribe\n If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP\n\n🔗Other related links\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
