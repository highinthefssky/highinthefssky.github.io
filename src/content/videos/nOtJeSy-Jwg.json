  "description": "In this addon spotlight we are going to look at the H-60 project which has been released yesterday. The project contains two types of helicopters the MH-60 Romeo and the UH-60 Blackhawk. Both helicopters are provided with multiple liveries.\n\nAfter having a look at the interior and exterior we are trying to take off with the helicopter which is kind of a challenge but eventually we are going airborne after a few attempts.\n\nIf you want to also add these to helicopters to MSFS 2020 download it via the link below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/21192/native-h-60-project-wip\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
