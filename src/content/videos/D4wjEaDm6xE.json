  "description": "As we all know MSFS is a resource intensive game. As not all of us have the budget to buy an extreme machine which can handle MSFS easily this sometimes requires you to tweak several settings to get the best performance. On Youtube several people have posted how to optimize MSFS  so I am not going to discuss how to do that, although I will give you some small hints what I did which resulted in a great performance. In this video we will specifically look at which tools are available which help you to monitor the performance (mainly CPU and GPU) which will help you finetuning your system even further. Each tool has it benefits but also it's downsides which we will discuss to make it easier for you to decide which one to use.\n\nAll of the tools used in this video are free so you don't need to throw money against it. Below you will find the links to the tools discussed in this video so you can download them if you want to give them a try:\n\nXbox Game bar:\nhttps://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/xbox-game-bar/9NZKPSTSNW4P?hl=en-us&gl=us\n\nNvidia Geforce Experience:\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/nl-nl/geforce/geforce-experience/\n\nMSI Afterburner:\nhttps://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards\n\nFRAPS\nhttps://fraps.com/\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
