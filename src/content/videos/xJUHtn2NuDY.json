  "description": "In this video we will fly over the Perlan. Perlan is a prominent landmark in the Icelandic capital of Reykjavík. It is situated on the top of Öskjuhlíð hill. It was originally only a cluster of hot water tanks, but in 1991 it was converted to a building open to the public, and now hosts an exhibition, a planetarium, an observation deck, and a restaurant.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nPOI playlist: https://bit.ly/3OX9zwv\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #shorts",
