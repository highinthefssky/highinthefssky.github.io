  "description": "In this video we will fly to Stockholm and have a look at all POI's which have been added as part of World Update V to MSFS 2020. Stockholm has several POI's which are looking really nice so if you like nice palaces and arena's it is definitely a good idea to fly over Stockholm yourself.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
