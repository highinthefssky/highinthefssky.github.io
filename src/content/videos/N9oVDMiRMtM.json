  "description": "Based on several questions of a video posted a long time ago I decided to post another part which looks at how to use the MCDU in the Airbus A320 (default) for flight planning. In this video we are going to look specifically at two questions:\n\n- how to delete a flight plan\n- how to use airways in a flight plan\n\nwarning: due to a possible bug in MSFS the airways part is shown but might not work in your case.\n\n00:00 intro\n00:10 deleting the flight plan\n03:12 using airways\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nHow to spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/49LlxEU\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
