  "description": "In this addon spotlight we are going to fly using Jetpack JW1 SkyTraveler which will allow you to fly with a jetpack on your back. I must say it is a complete different experience compared to flying in a aircraft but flying through cities or nice nature is pretty cool.\n\nThe addon is still in development but already can be used pretty well. Handling of it is OK although some pieces are pretty hard which you will also see in this video.\n\nIf you want to give the jetpack a try yourself you can find the download on the site below::\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/19306/jetpack-jw1-skytraveler\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
