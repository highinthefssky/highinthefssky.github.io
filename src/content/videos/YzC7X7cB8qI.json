  "description": "You might be familiar with the auto throttle functionality of aircrafts. Using this functionality the aircraft will maintain the speed which the pilot has preset. In this how to we are going to look at how to use this option in the Cessna Citation Longitude aircraft in MSFS. The cool thing about this aircraft is that there are 2 ways to set the maximum speed: manually and using the FMS. In this video we will have a look at both options and also do a short flight to show how it really works.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
