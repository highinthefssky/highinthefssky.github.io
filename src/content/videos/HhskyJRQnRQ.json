  "description": "In this video we will fly to Helsinki and have a look at all POI's which have been added as part of World Update V to MSFS 2020. Helsinki has a few POI's several related to sport and 2 cathedrals. In addition there is one additional POI Suomenlinna which looks to be a very old construction but if you have more info about it feel free to add it to the comment section.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
