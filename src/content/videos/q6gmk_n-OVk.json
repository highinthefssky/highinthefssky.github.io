  "description": "In this video we will look at how to reconfigure the flight management system (FMS) once an approach has been assigned to us by the ATC. We start with configuring the right approach but as expected the aircraft will start to turn. This is something which all aircrafts are experiencing so we will also look at how to resolve this in the Concorde.\n\nIf you would like to try Concorde yourself download it from the site below:\nhttps://www.justflight.com/product/dc-designs-concorde-microsoft-flight-simulator\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
