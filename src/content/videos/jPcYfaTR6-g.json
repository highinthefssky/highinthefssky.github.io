  "description": "Maybe I am the only one but the default camera positions in the A320 from Fenix Simulations are pretty frustrating and if you will navigate to far you will end up in the back of the aircraft. I was that frustrated that I decided to setup custom camera views to easier navigate to the cockpit. In this video I will show you how you can do this relatively easy and save yourself a lot of frustrations.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
