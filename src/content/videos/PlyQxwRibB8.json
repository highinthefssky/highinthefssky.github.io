  "description": "In this video I will show you how you can plan a flight including selecting a departure and approach by using the built-in planner from Flight Simulator 2020.\nWe will depart from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (EHAM) and will plan a flight to Kennedy International Airport (KJFK) in New York.\nOnce the main flight is planned we will look at the effect of changing the departure route (SID) and selecting a terminal approach route (STAR). As last point we will look at the nav log and how you can use it.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
