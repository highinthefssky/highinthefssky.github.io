  "description": "In this video we will look at the latest 2 builds of Sim Update 14 beta which have been released this week. Based on the release notes of the second build it looks like this might be the final build which will also become the GA version. Unfortunately the A320 V2 has been removed due to stability issues mainly on the console version but don't worry there are enough fixes and some new features will make this update still very valuable.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
