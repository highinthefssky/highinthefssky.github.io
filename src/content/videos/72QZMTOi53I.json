  "description": "In this video we are going to look at the Icon A5 upgraded G3X avionics & autopilot mod. Which is a mod which has a dependency on the Working Title G3x mod. Using this mod you will get an autopilot function in the A5 which is a nice addition and also people on my channel requested why this functionality was missing. Well good new install the addon and you will have the functionality. Keep in mind that there are still some limitations using this mod but it is a good starting point and hope fully more functionality will be added in the future to ensure operating the autopilot becomes a bit easier.\n\nThe mod can be downloaded from the site below:\n\nIcon A5 Upgraded G3X Avionics & Autopilot Mod:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/6897/icon-a5-upgraded-g3x-avionics-autopilot-mod\n\nG3X Mod:\nhttps://github.com/Working-Title-MSFS-Mods/fspackages/releases/tag/gx-v0.1.0-dev5\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: http://bit.ly/3qyiKXW\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
