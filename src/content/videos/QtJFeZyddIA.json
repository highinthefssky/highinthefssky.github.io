HINT: use the flight planner of MSFS 2020 to  find out which airport is close to the POI.\n\nDISCLAIMER: you cannot win anything except the honor ;-)\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nQuiz playlist: http://bit.ly/3iwJy8g\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
