  "description": "In this video we will have a look at the FA 18C hornet which has been released as a free download on flightsim.to. The aircraft has been developed by DC Designs & CJ Simulations based on the original Hornet which was part of FSX. Don't expect it to be the quality of a paid add-on but it is a good starting point to be developed further by the community. First we will look at how to install it and after that will have a look how it looks both in the cockpit but also outside. Once we completed that step we will take it out for a short flight.\n\nIf you want to give the fighter a try visit the link below to download it\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/48739/msfs-f-a-18c-legacy-hornet\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
