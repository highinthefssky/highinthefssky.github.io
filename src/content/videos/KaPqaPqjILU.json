  "description": "In this video we will look at the update release for the Airbus H135 Helicopter. Several adjustments were made amongst them:\n\n- changes to the flight model\n- improvements for the auto pilot\n- new functions/parts on the helicopter\n\nKeep in mind that if you previously used a custom livery that it needs to be updated to make sure it also paints the new part of the helicopter correctly.\n\nIf you also want to give the helicopter a try you can download it from the site below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/8970/airbus-h135-helicopter-project\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
