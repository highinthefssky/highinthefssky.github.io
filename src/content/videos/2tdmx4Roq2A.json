  "description": "In this video we will look at how you can use the outer/middle/inner markers using a VOR beacon. This functionality can be used is you have an airplane which doesn't have GPS, for example the Cessna 152. After configuring the frequency which belongs to runway 16L we will ask for permission to land and start our approach and use the markers to make sure we are on the glidepath.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
