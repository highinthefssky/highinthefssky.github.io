  "description": "Flugplatz Hidelsheim-Drispenstedt (EDVM) has received an update in MSFS which will add a lot of detail. Not only the airport itself received an update but also the near surroundings of the airport. The airport is suitable only for gliders and smaller aircrafts so don't try one of the larger aircrafts unless you want to challenge yourself.\n\nFor a full overview of items added to the marketplace this week have a look at the video below:\nhttps://youtu.be/So7dN5o73Ug\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: http://bit.ly/3qyiKXW\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #Shorts",
