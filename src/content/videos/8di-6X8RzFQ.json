  "description": "In this video we will fly over the St. Nicholas and St. Mary's Church. St. Nicholas Church (German: Nikolaikirche) is the oldest of the three major parish churches of the Hanseatic city of Stralsund in Germany. It was dedicated in 1279 to St. Nicholas of Myra, the patron saint of sailors. Since 1524 it is an Evangelical Lutheran church.\n\nSt. Mary's Church, is a beautiful old Lutheran church located at Marienstraße 16, the city of Stralsund, northern Germany. It is known as one of the oldest and one of the tallest churches in Germany, built in the early 13th century. The church is an excellent example of an early Gothic style, namely brick Gothic. The original bell tower of the church was over 500 feet long, but the current one is only about 340 feet.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nPOI playlist: https://bit.ly/3OX9zwv\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #shorts",
