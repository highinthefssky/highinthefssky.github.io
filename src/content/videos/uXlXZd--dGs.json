  "description": "In this video we will have a look at the 4rd beta build of Sim Update 15. Not to many fixes are included in this update based on the release notes. The Garmin G3x touch received most fixes as well as new functionality. In addition to this a control fix for multi engine helicopters has been added which will support helicopter with multiple engines so we probably should keep our eyes open for those soon.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
