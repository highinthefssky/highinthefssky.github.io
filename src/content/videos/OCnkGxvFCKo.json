  "description": "In this video we are going to look at the Boeing 247D created by Win42 which has been released yesterday. We start with a review of the available liveries and check which failures we can apply to the aircraft. After this we will have a look at the documentation which is being delivered as part of the aircraft. We continue reviewing the exterior and interior after that and will try to start the engines but that is harder as I expected so do expect a follow up movie on that ;-)\n\nIf you would like to try Boeing 247D yourself buy your ow copy from the site below:\nhttps://wing42.com/product/boeing-247d-for-msfs/?v=796834e7a283\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
