  "description": "In this video we will have a look at what has been added and fixed in Sim Update 14 for MSFS 2020 which has been released a few hours ago. The update contains both generic fixes as well as cockpit and aircraft updates. Is there also sad news? Yes there is the A320 V2 did not make the certification and has been removed from this update. Asobo already mentioned this last week so not a real surprise but still a pitty.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
