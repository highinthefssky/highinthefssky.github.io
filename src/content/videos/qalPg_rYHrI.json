This will result in the aircraft to turn around and fly back to the previous waypoint, or in some cases the autopilot is completely lost and goes crazy.\n\nWe just got or instructions from ATC which runway and intersection we should use so enjoy this video.\n\nKudo's to Parry Lagler for providing the instructions on how to fix this issue. \n\nWorking Title CJ4 can be downloaded from this site: https://github.com/Working-Title-MSFS-Mods/fspackages\n\nThe V abbreviations can be found on the site below:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_speeds\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
