  "description": "In this video we are going to look at the latest beta release of the Robinson R44 Raven II helicopter. The most important fix is the throttle issue which was introduced in the latest MSFS 2020, so no workaround is needed anymore. Besides this the helicopter performance and textures were optimized which make the helicopter even better. Again good quality from the development team.\n\nIf you also want to give the Robinson R44 Raven II helicopter a try download it the helicopter and the prereqs via the links below:\n\nHelicopter:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/20566/robinson-r44-raven-ii-helicopter-project\n\nAirlandFS:\nhttps://nl.flightsim.to/file/21417/airlandfs\n\nGMS750:\nhttps://pms50.com/msfs/\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
