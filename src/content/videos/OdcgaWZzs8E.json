  "description": "In this video we will look at the  Douglas DC6 which has been released yesterday by PMDG. The aircraft is something totally different to fly with when used to for example a A320 or 787 but it definitely is a very cool experience. We will do a quick overview in this video after which we take off and go airborne. Keep an eye on my channel for new how to's specifically for this aircraft because I will definitely will create some.  \n\nIf you also want to give the aircraft a try you can download it from the site below:\nhttps://pmdg.com/pmdg-dc-6-for-msfs/\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
