  "description": "In this video we will look at the Hawker Hurricane MKI which has been recently updated to a new version. This update is a small one compared to the previous releases but the good thing is that it is now available with 2 new deliveries compared to version 1.0.8. In version 1.0.8 several liveries were already added but version 1.0.9 contains the livery for the Memorial Hurricane which was flown by Gp Capt Peter Townsend CVO DSO DFC* as part of the King's Cup Air race which he finished second. \n\nIf you also want to give this aircraft a try download your own copy from:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/23757/hawker-hurricane-mkii\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
