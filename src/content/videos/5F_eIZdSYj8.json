  "description": "The C17 Globemaster just received a new update. The developers have updated the version to 1.0 because most functionality of the aircraft is now working. I must say I am really impressed by the list of changes they added in this first official of the aircraft. Besides the aircraft enhancement it now comes with a manual which contains some explanation about where to find stuff and also a few procedures. Those last items are still in progress.\n\nAfter we look at the exterior and interior we take it out for a flight. For some reason the taxying wasn't very smooth so I quickly reload it with the aircraft on the runway so we can fly and test functionalities like the autopilot.\n\nIf you want to try the aircraft yourself please download it from the site below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/12408/msfs-native-c-17-globemaster\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
