  "description": "In this addon spotlight we are going to look at the great wall of China and specifically the Mutianyu Section. The addon has been released earlier this month but I just spotted it on flightsim.to and thought it would be nice to create a video about it. The wall is pretty detailed and even includes a cable car which brings visitors to the top of the wall.\n\nIf you want to also add the great wall of China to MSFS 2020 download it from the site below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/18761/the-great-wall-of-china-mutianyu-section\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
