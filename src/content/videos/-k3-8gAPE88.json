The aircraft has the same cockpit as the A32NX from FBW but if you don't have the FBW version installed no problem because this aircraft has it's own copy. The airplane has been updated with new camera views (based on the FBW version) and the MCDU received 2 important updated: one to update the max block fuel and another option to set the max PAX to 298.\n\nIf you also want to give this aircraft a try download your own copy from:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/18198/airbus-a330-900neo-conversion\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
