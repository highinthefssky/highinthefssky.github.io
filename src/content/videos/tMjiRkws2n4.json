  "description": "Have you ever fantasized about landing a military aircraft at an African Air Force base? With the recent update, this is now a reality at the Ysterplaat Air Force Base (AFB), situated in the Cape Town suburb of Ysterplaat, along the southwestern coast of South Africa. The name 'Ysterplaat' originates from the Afrikaans adaptation of the Dutch word \"Ijzerplaats,\" which translates to \"Iron Place\" or \"Place of Iron\" in English.\n\nThe base proudly bears the motto Fortiter In Re, meaning \"Resolute in Action.\"\n\nThe latest enhancements have introduced numerous details that authentically represent an AFB. Without this update, one might not even recognize its military nature. An array of military scenery objects has been incorporated, predominantly as static displays, although discerning their static nature was challenging based on the information provided.\n\nFor a full overview of items added to the marketplace this week have a look at the video below:\nhttps://youtu.be/vNKBY9nTXz4\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: http://bit.ly/3qyiKXW\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #Shorts",
