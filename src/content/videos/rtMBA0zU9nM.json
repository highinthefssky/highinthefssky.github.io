  "description": "The marketplace for MSFS has welcomed a new addition: the Boeing 767-300ER. The Boeing 767, an American wide-body airliner, was developed by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It originated from the 7X7 program, launched on July 14, 1978. The prototype took its maiden flight on September 26, 1981, and received certification on July 30, 1982. The first variant, the 767-200, commenced service with United Airlines on September 8, 1982, followed by the extended-range 767-200ER in 1984. The aircraft was then extended to the 767-300 in October 1986 and further to the extended-range 767-300ER in 1988, which became the most popular variant. In October 1995, the 767-300F, a freighter version, was introduced. The design was expanded once more to the 767-400ER starting in September 2000. The level of detail is pretty nice even wear can be seen in the cockpit which makes it feel more real. Also the cabin itself has been developed although not with to many details.\n\nFor a full overview of items added to the marketplace this week have a look at the video below:\nhttps://youtu.be/hU3dQiozwWk\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: http://bit.ly/3qyiKXW\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #Shorts",
