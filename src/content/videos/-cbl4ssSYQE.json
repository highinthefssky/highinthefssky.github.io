  "title": "Flight Simulator 2020 - Airbus A320 - Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg hyperlapse",
  "description": "In this video I will fly from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg. Landing went pretty smooth although I needed to do a go around as instructed by ATC (after providing me clearance first ;-)) due to another aircraft which was still on the runway. Second approach went smooth and I landed pretty well on the runway of Johannesburg.\nThis video is a hyperlapse which means the video which normally was approximately 2 hour has been shorted to approximately 5 minutes. The audio of the game is removed completely and as a replacement music has been added.\n\nThe software I used to create the hyperlapse is Microsoft Hyperlapse Pro. More information about the tool can be found on the site below:\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/computational-photography-applications/microsoft-hyperlapse-pro/\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/31twppJ\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
