  "description": "🔍 Description\n🚀 This week brings a few new packages, mostly for larger airline aircraft like the A320 and Boeing 737, along with one that lets you explore Iceland. The 737 package introduces several missions to fly with the Boeing 737 Max, but make sure to check the description as some may require a third-party version of the aircraft. For those looking to add a retro livery to a modern A320, the America West Heritage package is the perfect choice.\n\n📹 Other marketplace additions\nIf you are looking for either the new enhanced scenery and enhanced airports or new aircrafts and liveries review the respective video by clicking on one if the links below:\n\n- New enhanced scenery and airports: https://youtu.be/JBtyq-vQG6k\n- New aircrafts & stunning liveries: https://youtu.be/PBjmusirvJg\n\n\n🔔 Subscribe\n If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP\n\n🔗Other related links\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSim #fs2024 #FlightSimulator2024",
