The most import fixes and new functionalities will be seen when using it in combination with the Xbox. Using this firmware in combination with Sim Update 10 (released mid September) both the chronometer and status indicator panel will also work on the Xbox. If you are participating in the beta of Sim Update 10 you can already try out this functionality.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
