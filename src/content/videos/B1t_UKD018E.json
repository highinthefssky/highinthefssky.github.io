  "description": "In this addon spotlight we are going to look at the De Havilland dh89a Dragon Rapide. The de Havilland is a two engine biplane of wood and fabric construction and has six to eight seats to carry passengers.\n\nFirst we look from the outside before we have a look at the cockpit. Once we had a look at that we will start the engines and make a take off from Eelde airport for a short flight.\n\nIf you want to also add this airplane to MSFS 2020 download it via the link below:\nhttp://www.sim-outhouse.com/sohforums/local_links.php?catid=243\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
