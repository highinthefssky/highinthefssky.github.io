  "description": "In this video we will fly over Hells Gate Airtram. The Hells Gate Airtram is an aerial tramway that crosses Fraser Canyon immediately above Hells Gate. It starts at a parking lot off the Trans-Canada Highway and descends to its lower terminal on the opposite side of the canyon where there is an observation deck, a restaurant, a gift shop and other tourist attractions. It was built in 1970 by the Swiss manufacturer Habegger Engineering Works and opened on 21 July 1971.[1] Before its construction, the only way to the observation deck was to hike down the canyon to the pedestrian suspension bridge that bridges the canyon.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nPOI playlist: https://bit.ly/3OX9zwv\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #shorts",
