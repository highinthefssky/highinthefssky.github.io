  "description": "In this how to we are going to look how you can use the navigation systems in the Fokker VIIb retrofit aircraft. Prior to departing I will show you how you can find both VOR's and NDB's easily using the navigation systems onboard. After that we will setup the correct frequencies in the different systems while flying and show you how you can use the VOR system. Reason we cannot use the NDB is that for some reason there is no way of changing the second digit. This looks like to be a bug bit if you have found a solution please leave it in the comments.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
