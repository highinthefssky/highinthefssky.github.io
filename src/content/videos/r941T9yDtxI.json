  "description": "In this video we will have a look at one of the most detailed airport there currently is for MSFS 2020. It is Duxford Airfield (EGSU).\n\nThe airfield looks to be an old military aircraft which can now be used by civilians based on some information I found. The level of details of each component is really magnificent.\n\nBesides the airfield you will find IWM Duxford which is Europe's largest air museum. \n\nIf you want to add more cool things I would recommend you to add the Duxford airshow also which add multiple additional airplanes to the scenery.\n\nFirst want to look if it is something for you have a look at the video and decide afterwards.\n\nIf you want to try the addons yourself download them via the link below:\n\nDuxford Airfield (EGSU) - complete\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/28581/egsu-duxford-airfield-complete-edition\n\nDuxford airshow\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/22075/egsu-duxford-airshow-addon\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
