  "description": "In this video we will fly over the Cardston Alberta Temple. The Cardston Alberta Temple (formerly the Alberta Temple) is the eighth constructed and sixth of the still-operating temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Located in Cardston, Alberta, it is the church's oldest temple outside the United States. It is one of eight temples that does not have an angel Moroni statue, and one of six without spires, similar to Solomon's Temple.[1] It is also one of only two temples the church built in the shape of a cross, the other being the Laie Hawaii Temple.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nPOI playlist: https://bit.ly/3OX9zwv\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #shorts",
