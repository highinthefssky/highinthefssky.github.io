  "description": "It has been released: World Update VII Australia. In this video we will do our fourth flight above Australia and we are going to visit Townsville this time. Townsville received a photogrammetry update and some POI's were added. The number of POI's is pretty limited compared to Melbourne and the same is applicable to the photogrammetry content. However the content which has been updated looks really nice.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #4K #Xbox #XboxseriesX",
