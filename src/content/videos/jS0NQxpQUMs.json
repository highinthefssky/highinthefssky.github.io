  "description": "In this video we will have a look at the Bell Nexus version 0.2 which has been recently released and is base on the HALO Pelican aircraft which has been released a while ago. The aircraft is still in development so do expect that it will be updated with some nice features in the future. Controlling the aircraft is similar to the HALO Pelican aircraft and is pretty easy.\n\n0:00 intro\n0:10 exterior and interior review\n8:18 taking off for a small flight\n\nIf you also want to give the aircraft a try you can download it from the site below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/36086/bell-nexus\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
