  "description": "In this short we will perform a free fall above Mumbai using the Ornithopter from the Dune Expansion pack for MSFS. However this one is special. Due to the high speed we have you can see the Ornithopter continues to climb until the speed has decreased that far that the Ornithopter falls down and performs the free fall.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #Shorts",
