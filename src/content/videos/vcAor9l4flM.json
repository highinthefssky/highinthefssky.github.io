  "description": "In this how to we are going to look at how to customize key bindings. Based on my own experience as well as from some of my subscribers it looks like something has changed after a specific update (I think SU5) which allows you to assign multiple functions to the same button which results in unexpected behavior. In this video I will show you how you can correctly reassign functions to previously used keys/buttons.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
