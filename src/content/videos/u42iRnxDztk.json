  "description": "In this how to we are going to look how we you can refuel during the bush runs which are part of Flight Simulator 2020.\nI think it was in the 5th or 6th leg of the bush trip when the engine of the aircraft suddenly stopped. Once that happened I looked t the fuel meter and saw it was almost empty... At that moment I thought I should have checked the fuel level prior to departing. So a good learning point for next time. Since there was no other airport near me the only way was to safely land  somewhere else, I chose to land near the road. Once landed I went back and looked at the airports I landed before and found one which I could use to land. Now you of course want to know which one? Check the video and you will find out.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
