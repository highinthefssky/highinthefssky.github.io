  "description": "In this addon spotlight we are going to look at London Stansted Airport (EGSS) version 1.0 which has been released a few days ago. This addon has been created by a community member and I am pretty impressed about the level of quality of this airport. If you are flying from the UK on a regular based using MSFS 2020 this is definitely an addon which you want to give a try.\n\nIf you want to give the airport a try yourself you can download it from the site below: \nhttps://flightsim.to/file/18965/london-stansted-airport-egss\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
