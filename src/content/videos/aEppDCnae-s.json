  "description": "In this video we look at the Messerschmitt BF109 E4 which has just been released for MSFS. The aircraft is still under development which means some parts of the aircraft do require some more attention. After we had a look at the exterior we will look inside the cockpit and take it out for a short flight.\n\nIf you also want to give this aircraft a try download your own copy from:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/26971/messerschmit-bf109-e4\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
