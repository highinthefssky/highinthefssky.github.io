  "description": "In this video we will look at the Hawker Sea Hawk jet which has been release a few days back. The aircraft is pretty detailed and is fully functional. The cockpit contains several buttons but not all of them are working yet. Once we looked at the interior and exterior we will taxi to the runway and fly over downtown Seattle.\n\nIf you also want to give this aircraft a try download your own copy from:\nhttp://www.sim-outhouse.com/sohforums/local_links.php?catid=247\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
