  "description": "In this video we will fly over Point Udall. Point Udall is at the east end of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands. It is the easternmost point (by travel, not longitude) of the United States including insular areas. It was named in 1969 for Stewart Udall, United States Secretary of the Interior under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson.\n\nA sundial known as the Millennium Monument was built above Point Udall for the New Year's celebration in 2000 — it marks the azimuth of the first U.S. sunrise of that year. From the monument an informal trail of moderate difficulty leads down to the point, which is composed primarily of uplifted and rotated volcanic and sedimentary rocks of Upper Cretaceous origin.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nPOI playlist: https://bit.ly/3OX9zwv\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #shorts",
