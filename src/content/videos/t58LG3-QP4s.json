  "description": "In this video we will look at the UH 1C Hue Gunship helicopter. The helicopter has been recently released but it still under development. To use it you will need to install AirlandFS and load the profile which is included in the zip file.\n\nAfter we looked at how to load the AirlandFS profile we look at the exterior of the helicopter before we jump into the cockpit. Once we reviewed everything we take the helicopter out for a small ride.\n\nIf you also want to give this aircraft a try download your own copy from:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/24313/uh-1c-huey-gunship\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
