  "title": "Fenix A320: Sim Update 4 Beta - Build 1 vs Build 2 Performance Test! Is It Better? 🤔",
  "description": "It's the ultimate beta showdown! We're putting the two latest builds of Sim Update 4 head-to-head to answer the community's biggest question: is the second build a true upgrade for performance?\n\nJoin us in the sophisticated flight deck of the Fenix A320 as we fly from Belfast (EGAA) to London Gatwick (EGKK), not once, but twice! In this video, we're directly comparing Sim Update 4 Beta Build 1 against Build 2. We'll be putting footage and performance metrics side-by-side, focusing on FPS, stutters, and overall smoothness to see if there's a noticeable difference. ✈️⚙️\n\nHeads-up for our test: While we tried to keep everything identical, the live weather wasn't a 100% perfect match between the two flights. We'll highlight any differences, but this should still give us a fantastic idea of the changes in the new build! 🌦️\n\nWhether you're in the beta or waiting for the final release, this video will show you what to expect.\n\n👇 What have you noticed between the two beta builds?
