  "description": "Buckle up, virtual pilots! We're heading to Lipari Fly Airfield (LIM5) in beautiful Sicily, and you won't believe these runways! 😮 This Voyager Sim Project creation features not one, but two sloping runways, plus all the fixings: a large apron, multiple hangars, and even helipads. 🚁\nExperience challenging ILS approaches, incredible elevation changes, and a detailed walking environment that brings this airport to life in Microsoft Flight Simulator. Join me as I put LIM5 through its paces, tackling those concave and convex runway surfaces and giving you my honest opinion!\n\n🤔 What do you think of airports with unusual features?
