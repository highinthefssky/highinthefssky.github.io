  "description": "In this video we will look at the lighthouse Cape St. Vincent which has been released as a free addon for MSFS 2020. The lighthouse wasn't part of the latest World Update so one of the developers started to develop the lighthouse and decided to make it animated. We will start flying during daylight but to show the animated piece of the addon we will switch to the evening hours. During the evening hours you will see the light clearly being displayed which results in a nice effect.\n\nIf you would like to try the scenery yourself, download it via the link below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/28787/lighthouse-cape-st-vincent-animated\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
