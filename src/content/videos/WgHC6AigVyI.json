  "description": "In this video we will have a look at the changes to the VFR map coming as part of  Sim Update 10 which will be released next month. The version which we will have a look at is subject to change due to the fact the final version of the Sim Update is not available yet. Asobo has spend some serious time adding things to the VFR map which will be liked by a lot of people and make it easier to find information about airports and beacons during flights.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
