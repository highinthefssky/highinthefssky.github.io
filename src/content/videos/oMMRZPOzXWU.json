  "description": "In this video I will fly from Barcelona airport to Circuit de Catalunya to drop the F1 drivers from Red Bull Racing. The video doesn't include the actual landing but gives an overview of the city of Barcelona and the F1 circuit itself.\n\nI am using the Airbus H135 helicopter with the Red Bull livery. If you also want to use them please download them via the links below:\n\nAirbus H135 helicopter:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/8970/airbus-h135-helicopter-project\n\nRed Bull livery for Airbus H135 helicopter:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/12916/airbus-h135-red-bull-racing-honda-f1-team\n\nThis video is a hyperlapse which means the video which normally was approximately 18 hour has been shorted to approximately 2 minutes. The audio of the game is removed completely and as a replacement music has been added.\n\nThe software I used to create the hyperlapse is Microsoft Hyperlapse Pro. More information about the tool can be found on the site below:\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/computational-photography-applications/microsoft-hyperlapse-pro/\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/31twppJ\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
