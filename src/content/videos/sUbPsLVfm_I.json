  "description": "In this how to I will show you how you can troubleshoot issues with landing challenges which are not working anymore. In my case I was hitting the issue with the strong wind landing challenges in Gibraltar and Funchal (at least I thought they were only affected ;-)). The error I received was that content or at least an item of the content was missing.\nIn this video I will show you step by step how I approached the issue and eventually found the root cause.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
