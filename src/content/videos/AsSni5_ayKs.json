  "description": "In this video I will show you have you can use Non Directional Beacons (NDB's) using a Cirrus SR22 aircraft. Compared to the Cessna 152 this aircraft has a different navigation system which required you to perform different steps to use ND beacons. In this video we will take off from Dundee Airport and fly to one of the NDB's which is close to the airport.\n\nI will use Little NavMap to find the information in addition to the build-in flight planner of MSFS 2020. If you also want to give Little NavMap follow the steps in this video to configure it for MSFS 2020 use:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1KYuA69vgNw\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
