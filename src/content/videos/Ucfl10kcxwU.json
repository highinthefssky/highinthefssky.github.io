  "description": "In this video I will fly from Rotterdam The Hague Airport to London City Airport. The weather was really cloudy and when coming closer to London it even started to rain. Approach could have been better but this was the first time I was do a full flight with an ATR-72-600. So I need to practice a bit more on the approach because it was to bumpy and speed was a little bit to high which resulted in some challenges at the end.\n\nThis video is a hyperlapse which means the video which normally was approximately 2 hour has been shorted to approximately 5 minutes. The audio of the game is removed completely and as a replacement music has been added.\n\nIf you want to give the ATR-72-600 a try you can find it on the site below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/12249/atr-72-600-community-version\n\nThe software I used to create the hyperlapse is Microsoft Hyperlapse Pro. More information about the tool can be found on the site below:\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/computational-photography-applications/microsoft-hyperlapse-pro/\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/31twppJ\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
