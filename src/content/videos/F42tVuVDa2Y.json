  "description": "In this video I will show you how I approached the Beach Blast at St Martin landing challenge and landed successfully on the runway. The first 2 tries a a bit bumpy the but last session was pretty OK although there is still some room for improvement. Keep in mind that this landing challenge is not part of the default MSFS 2020 installation but requires you to have the Landing Challenge Pro software from SoFly.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP🔔 \n\nLive events playlist: https://bit.ly/2Yfagtl\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
