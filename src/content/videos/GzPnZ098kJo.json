  "description": "In this video we will fly over Pontcysyllte Aquaduct. Pontcysyllte, meaning ‘the bridge that connects’, carries the canal majestically over the raging River Dee below.\n\nDesigned by Thomas Telford and Williams Jessop and constructed by John Simpson (stonework) and William Hazledine (ironwork), the aqueduct was completed in 1805, and is a result of some bold civil engineering solutions. A cast iron trough suspended 126 feet above the river, supported iron arched ribs, carried on 18 hollowed masonry pillars.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nPOI playlist: https://bit.ly/3OX9zwv\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #shorts",
