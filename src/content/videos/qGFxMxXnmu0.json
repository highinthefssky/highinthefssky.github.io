  "description": "In this video, we will explore the update that was released earlier today. The AIRAC cycle 2409 became available today, and if you're subscribed to Navigraph, you probably noticed the announcement on X a few hours ago. Typically, it takes several days for Asobo to make it available, but they seem to be making an effort to expedite this process, as the AIRAC cycle 2409 is now also accessible for MSFS.\n\nFurthermore, Asobo has released the final set of community-updated airports via the World Hub tool. It's important to note that no new airport updates submitted through this tool will be released this year, as previously announced by Asobo.\n\nAs is customary, we will employ PowerShell techniques to check the directory and file changes after installing the update.\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
