  "description": "In this video we will have a look at the EFB which will be added as part of Sim Update 12 to the Curtiss JN-4 \"Jenny\". Although it is pretty limited compared to EFB's in other aircrafts it is a nice addition and might be very helpful when flying this aircraft.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
