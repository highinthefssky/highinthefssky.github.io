  "description": "In this video we will have a look at Venice which has received a massive update as part of World Update IX. Both the photogrammetry content and the number of POI's have been improved. Based on a first look I think Venice received one of the most POI's per square meter which I have ever seen in MSFS.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
