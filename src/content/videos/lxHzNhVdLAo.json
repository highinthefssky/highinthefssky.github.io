This TBM 930 tutorial covers the Pratt & Whitney PT6 engine start sequence, \"Cold and Dark\" procedures, and taxiing techniques for beginners. Welcome to Part 3 of our series! We’re diving deep into this high-performance turboprop to show you exactly how to wake the beast without causing a \"hot start.\"\nIn this episode, we break down the essentials: performing a proper Pre-Start Flow, managing the ITT (Interstage Turbine Temperature) during ignition, and mastering the Art of Beta for smooth taxiing. We’re also getting hands-on with the overhead panel, fuel systems, and engine indication systems (EIS) to ensure your aircraft is healthy and ready for the runway.\n\nStay tuned until the end for a \"nice-to-know\" pro tip regarding the Inertial Separator!\n\n📖 Chapters\nIn this video, we cover:\n\n00:00 - TBM 930: The sound of silence \n01:07 - Pre-Start Flow: Setting the stage \n04:51 - Engine Start Sequence: managing the heat \n10:28 - After-Start cleanup & systems Check \n08:15 - TBM 930 Nice-to-Know Fact: Inertial Separator \n15:17 - Taxiing: The Art of Beta Range \n23:27 - Line-Up: the final configuration\n27:08 - Takeoff: 850 horsepower unleashed\n30:20 - Conclusion & week 4 Teaser\n\n📷 Quick camera views\n- shift 1: primary flight display (PFD)\n- shift 2: multi function display (MFD)\n- shift 3: autopilot controls\n- shift 4: overview of PFD, MFD, autopilot controls, A/C, de ice system, landing gear,  pressurization and hot air flow\n- shift 5: throttle, trim, flap controls and fuel selector\n- shift 6: external/internal lights, electric power, engine start, fuel, ap/trims, ELT and oxygen controls\n- shift 7: similar like the previous option but including the panel emer\n- shift 8: power plugs\n- shift 9: left door\n- shift 0: passenger door\n\n💬 Question of the day: Have you ever experienced a \"Hot Start\" in a turboprop?
