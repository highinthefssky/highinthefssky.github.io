  "description": "In our previous video about the Garmin G1000 NXi we discussed the new options available including the hold feature. At that specific time I couldn't find how to use the option. Luckily I found how to do it using the Garmin G1000 NXi manual. In this video we will look at how to configure a user-defined hold and what the effect of that hold will be on the flight plan and the instruments in the cockpit.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
