  "description": "Probably you have been in the scenario where you tried to start an airplane in the middle of the night in MSFS 2020. In these scenarios a light would be helpful right? If you are lucky the airport has some lights and you might be able to spot the right buttons but in some cases you won't have any help from external. In these scenarios you can use the headlamp or flashlight function in MSFS 2020. Watch the video to see how you can use it and benefit from it next time you are trying to start your airplane in a dark area.\n\nThanks Göran Linder for pointing out to this functionality.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
