  "description": "In this how to we are going to look how we can use the PAPI lights during a landing on runway 22R from the  Nice Cote D'Azur Airport (LFMN).\n\nWe will first discuss what the PAPI lights are and after that we will take off. Once we are airborne we make some turns to the left and will fly parallel to the runway. \n\nOnce we passed the airport we make 2 final left turns and will land on runway 22R using the PAPI lights to ensure we are at the ideal glideslope.\n\nIf you first want to read more about the PAPI lights consider reading the article below:\n\nhttps://highintheflightsimsky.nl/What-are-PAPI-lights/\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
