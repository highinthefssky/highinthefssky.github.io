  "description": "In this video we will have a quick look what has been included in City Update 3. The thing which surprised me is that this CU is coming really soon after City Update 2 which has been recently released. However if you review the release notes and after that look at the download size you understand why this one could be release pretty quick.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
