  "description": "In this video we will have an initial look at the Reno Air race addon pre-release testing version which has been made available by Asobo earlier today. We will have a look at how to install the package itself and what is available after it is installed. Unfortunately no one was available to fly with so   I cannot share how the experience is flying with the airplanes added as part of the Reno Air race addon pre-release version.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a pre-release version and things might look different in the final version. If you are also testing and are hitting an issue use the feedback tool to make Asobo aware of this.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
