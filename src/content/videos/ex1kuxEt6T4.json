  "description": "In this video we will have a look at Key Largo which received a photogrammetry update. Key Largo is located in front of the east coast of the US and has it's own very small airport and golfcourse. Especially the golf course can now be seen better due to the update it has received. If you want to do your own bushtrip this is potentially also a nice starting point which can take you to for example Key West.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
