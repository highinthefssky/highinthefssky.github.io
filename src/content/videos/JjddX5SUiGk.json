  "description": "In this how to we are going to look how we can configure our flight plan manually in our navigation system from our Robin Cap10. Setting up the flight plan will also include using an SID and STAR as bonus.\n\nRoute being configured will be from Rotterdam Airport (EHRD) to Ameland airport (EHAL) initially. But to show the full potential of the Garmin GNS 430 we will modify our flight and will change our destination to Lelystad airport (EHLE).\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
