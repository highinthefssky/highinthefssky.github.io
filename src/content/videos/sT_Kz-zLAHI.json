  "description": "In this video we will fly over the Invercargill Water Tower. Completed in 1889 the Invercargill Water Tower was designed by William Sharp, a former PWD engineer who settled in Invercargill after being retrenched. Built of brick the tower stands 31.5m high and is a most impressive element in the townscape.\n\nThe square base has a hexagonal shaft which in turn supports the cylindrical water tank. The original structure had a striped cupola of ogee section giving an elegant cap to the tower. Removed in 1934 because of deterioration there are plans to have it replaced. A feature of the tower is the superb brickwork rich in detail and ornament. This striking element in the townscape forms a landmark in the flat terrain the more remarkable for being one of the outstanding industrial monuments of the country.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nPOI playlist: https://bit.ly/3OX9zwv\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #shorts",
