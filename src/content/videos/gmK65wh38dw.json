  "description": "In this video we will look at the Garmin G1000 NXi version 0.9.1 which has been released yesterday. Keep in mind it is still work in progress and is not compatible with the Working Title G1000. If you want to use the G1000 NXi you should remove the Working Title G1000 first.\n\nIn this update several issues are fixed which we reported after version 0.9.0 was released as part of Sim Update VII. Besides these fixes also the behavior of some of the components has changed which we will look at in this video.\n\nIf you also want to give the G1000 NXi a try visit the marketplace inside MSFS 2020 and download your own copy.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
