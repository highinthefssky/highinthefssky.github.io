  "description": "In this video we will look at the city of Amsterdam which has been updated  part of World Update IV: France/Benelux which has been released today. We are using our H135 chopper to fly over the city. Based on some testing with video settings it looks a bit choppy a some moments so I still have some work to do optimizing the settings again after this new update.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
