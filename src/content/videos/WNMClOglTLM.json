  "description": "In this video we will fly in parallel of the ﾃ僕and Bridge. The ﾃ僕and Bridge (Swedish: ﾃ僕andsbron) is a road bridge connecting Kalmar on mainland Sweden to Fﾃ､rjestaden on the island of ﾃ僕and to its east. At 6,072 meters (19,921 ft) long, it is one of the longest in all of Europe (the longest one until completion of Vasco da Gama Bridge in 1998). It is supported by 156 pillars, and has a characteristic hump at its western end which was created to provide a vertical clearance of 36 m for shipping.\n\n沐 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 沐 \n\nPOI playlist: https://bit.ly/3OX9zwv\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #shorts",
