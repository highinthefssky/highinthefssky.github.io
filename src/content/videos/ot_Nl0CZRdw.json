We start with a review of the liveries after which we will look at the exterior of the aircraft. Once we looked at the outside we will look inside the cabin and the cockpit.\n\nAfter we looked at multiple components we will start the engines and take the aircraft out for a short flight.\n\nIf you would like to try Concorde yourself download it from the site below:\nhttps://www.justflight.com/product/dc-designs-concorde-microsoft-flight-simulator\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
