  "description": "In this video we will look at version 1.5 of Oslo Gardermoen Airport. Besides the optimizations and custom ILS for the runway the developers have started to work on the interior of the terminals. And it is again quality work if you look at the level of detail it almost feels like you walk on the airport yourself. It is still work in progress because not all shops have all the details but I do expect that is just a matter of waiting for some new released before that is being implemented.\n\nIf you also want to give this airport a try download your own copy from:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/25434/oslo-gardermoen-airport-engm\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
