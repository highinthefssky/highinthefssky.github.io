  "description": "In this video we will have a look at a new aircraft which is in the early stages of development: the Boeing 767-300ER. Currently the aircraft is being developed and there is still a lot of work to do, both on the graphical level but also on the functional level, but it flies. I tried it with the 747 Salty Addon which was less successful so probably if you want to try it try it without the Salty addon first.\n\nIf you also want to give this airport a try download your own copy from:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/26107/native-767-300er-wip\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
