  "description": "A new beta version of the C-17 globemaster has been released today. The team of developers working on the aircraft have done a lot of work again. Besides Sim Update 7 compatibility the cockpit roof and walls did get painted but a feature which is really cool is the in-air reverse trust control which we will also use in this video.\n\nIf you want to try the aircraft yourself please download it from the site below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/12408/msfs-native-c-17-globemaster\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
