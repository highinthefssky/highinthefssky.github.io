  "description": "In this video we will have a look at Disney World which received a photogrammetry update as part of World Update X which was released already 2 weeks ago. We will fly over the different parts of the park and look at the scenery which has been added. It looks like some attractions have been added but the palace which is the trademark of Disney is not added as far as I checked out.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
