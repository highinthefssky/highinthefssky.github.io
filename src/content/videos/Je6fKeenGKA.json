  "description": "In this video we will have a look at the early access version of FlightSim Studio's E-jets 175 where E stands for Embraer. First we go to some details about the aircraft before we jump in MSFS and have a look at the different liveries. Once that is completed we do a full review of the exterior and interior. Be aware that the aircraft is still work in progress so don't expect the aircraft to fully work yet because it is still in progress. \n\nIf you are interested in buying the aircraft visit the link below:\nhttps://www.aerosoft.com/en/shop/microsoft-flight-simulator/msfs-aircraft/3979/flightsim-studio-e-jets-175\n\nIf you want to give Volanta a try download it via the link below:\nhttps://volanta.app/\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
