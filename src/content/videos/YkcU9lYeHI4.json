  "description": "In this video we will have a look at the Reno Air race addon pre-release testing version which has been made available by Asobo on Friday. This time I used an aircraft from the biplanes category and played on my Xbox Series X which allowed me to record in 4K. \n\nFlying on the Xbox using the Xbox controller is a complete different experience. So next step is to find the most optimal settings so I can start winning some races.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon Reno Air Race playlist: https://bit.ly/3Cbmc0T\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #Xbox #4K",
