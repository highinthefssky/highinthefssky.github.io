  "description": "In this addon spotlight we are going to look Marshall Island airport which is located on the south side of Majuro Atoll. The airport is pretty small which limits the type of aircrafts which can use this airport to only midsize airliners and propeller aircrafts. Due to the location where the airport is located it is probably a pretty challenging one to land on when there is a strong wind.\n\nIf you want to also add this airport to MSFS 2020 download it via the link below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/19529/pkmj-marshall-island-international-airport\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
