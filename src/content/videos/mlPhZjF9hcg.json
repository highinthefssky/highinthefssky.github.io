  "description": "In this how to we are going to look how you can calculate the optimal landing speed using the calculators available in the FlyPad. This is pretty useful due to the fact the calculator does allow you to show the impact of weight and also the different settings of the auto brake functionality of the aircraft. We will also look where to get the values from which are required as input for the calculator.\n\n0:00 title screen\n0:10 Flypad of the A320\n2:07 collecting the input data\n3:21 calculating the runway slope\n4:52 runway Localizer Directional Aid (LDA)\n08:15 impact of changing approach speed, weight and flaps\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
