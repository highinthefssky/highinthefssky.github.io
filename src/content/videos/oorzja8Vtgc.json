This week is a week with a lot of new items: mainly a lot of night enhancements and a small amount of new airports, aircrafts, helicopters as well as some mission packs and of course livery packs.  \n\nPlease provide feedback using the comment box below as I have been experimenting a lot to make the audio/voice quality better.
