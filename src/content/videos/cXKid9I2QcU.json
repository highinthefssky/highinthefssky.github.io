  "description": "In this video we will look at how you can program a flight using the FMS inside the ATR 42-600/72-600. Most default aircrafts allow you to plan a flight using the world map or load a FLT file. While this will work when using the ATR the issue is that the  FMS is not programmed which makes it impossible to use the autopilot functionalities as well as keep track of in which direction you want to fly when flying VFR. \n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
