  "description": "In this video we will fly over the Freilichtmuseum Gross Raden. The Groß Raden Archaeological Open Air Museum (German: Archäologische Freilichtmuseum Groß Raden) lies a few kilometres north of the small town of Sternberg and about a kilometre northeast of the village of Groß Raden in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The site is in a depression that borders directly onto the lake of Radener See. On a peninsula in front of that lies its circular castle rampart, visible from afar, which has a diameter of 50 metres. From 1973 to 1980 extensive excavations were carried out here, led by Ewald Schuldt, during the course of which the remnants of a Slavic settlement dating to the 9th and 10th centuries was unearthed. The fort has been reconstructed based on the excavations and established as an archaeological open-air museum. It has been enhanced by finds from the Slavic castle of Behren-Lübchin.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nPOI playlist: https://bit.ly/3OX9zwv\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #shorts",
