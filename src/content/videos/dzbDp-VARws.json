  "description": "In this video I will show you the AT 72-600 which is a large propeller plane which is currently being developed for MSFS 2020. The airplane is based on the FSX version and is converted to MSFS 2020. The airplane is using components of the CJ4 which is part of MSFS 2020. If you installed the Working Title CJ4 mod you might experience some issues with the aircraft in the current development stage. If that is the case and you still want to use the aircraft consider removing the Working Title CJ4 mod temporarily.  \n\nAs a bonus we will follow a Boeing 787 during take off using the drone view ;-)\n\nIf you want to try the aircraft yourself please download it from the site below:\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/9912/atr-72-600-working-cockpit\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
