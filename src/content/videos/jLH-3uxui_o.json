  "description": "In addon spot light we will look at the update MSFS Native C17 Globemaster airplane which has been updated a few days back. The aircraft received a complete revamped cockpit with several buttons now working. There is still some work to do but I am pretty impressed already.\n\nDuring the video I had some issues going airborn even on a very long runway the aircraft wouldn't go airborn. Even when using flaps it didn't want to go airborn. Probably I missed something if you find out what I missed let me know via the comments.\n\nIf you like to use the mod and the aircraft also please use the links below to download them:\n\nC-17 Globemaster\nhttps://flightsim.to/file/12408/msfs-native-c-17-globemaster",
