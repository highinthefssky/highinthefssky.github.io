  "description": "In this video we will look at the region of Normandy and especially the coastline which is famous as it's part in WW II. Multiple community members have spend their valuable time in updating the coastline and adding several WW II related buildings. In this addon spotlight we only fly over a few of them but the addon packs contain a lot more buildings/POI's.\n\nIf you also want to give this scenery a try you can download the used scenery packs via the links below:\n\nNormandy region:\nhttps://www.flightsim.to/file/14283/normandy-region\n\nOmaha beach:\nhttps://www.flightsim.to/file/2930/lf1456-omaha-beach\n\nJuno beach: \nhttps://flightsim.to/file/21389/juno-beach\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
