  "description": "In this how to we are going to look at how to program the Flight Management System (FMS) in a CJ4 with the Working Title CJ4 addon installed. The plan is to program the FMS to ensure we know the Vapp speed so we know what the ideal speed is to land. For this we need to program the FMS with several parameters which we will discuss in this video. Unfortunately the end of the video is not as successful as I hoped but that is something you will see at the end. \n\nWorking Title CJ4 can be downloaded from this site: https://github.com/Working-Title-MSFS-Mods/fspackages\n\nThe V abbreviations can be found on the site below:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_speeds\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
