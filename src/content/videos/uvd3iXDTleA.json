  "description": "In this addon spotlight we will have a look at the Landmarks Paris City Pack released by ORBX for MSFS 2020. This addon adds 15 high-detail custom landscape amongst them: Notre Dame, Panthéon, The Centre Pompidou, École Militaire, and Église Saint-Sulpice. Additionally 200 medium-detail custom landmarks are being added.\n\nWe will have a look at both the daytime and nighttime view while flying over the city. I must say I am again impressed by the high quality the ORBX team has delivered and can't wait for their next landmarks addon being released.\n\nThe addon can be downloaded from the site below:\nhttps://orbxdirect.com/product/landmarks-paris-msfs\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: http://bit.ly/3qyiKXW\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
