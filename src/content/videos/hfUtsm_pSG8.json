  "description": "In this video we will review the announcements which have been made just an hour ago during the Xbox and Bethesda Showcase 2022. The good thing is that we can expect a lot of additional aircrafts and helicopters from different types. Additionally some legacy locations which were part of Flight Simulator X and Flight Simulator 2004 will be added with this update. The 40th Anniversary Edition will be available in November. \n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
