  "description": "World Update VIII has been released earlier this week and has the focus on Portugal and Spain. In this video we will fly over Barcelona to see the points of interest which have been added to the city. The city already had several points of interest and photogrammetry content but now several ones have been added which make the city even nicer.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #4K #Xbox #XboxseriesX",
