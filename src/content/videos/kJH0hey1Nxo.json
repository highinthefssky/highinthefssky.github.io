  "description": "In this video, we provide a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to configure the VelocityOne FlightSystem Quadrant for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 (MSFS 2024) for a four-engines aircraft. \nWe will use the base configuration which we created in a previous video for a twin-engines aircraft and adjust it so you can use it to control the four-engines aircrafts included in Flight Simulator 2024.\n\nWe first look at a setup where you will split the engines in pairs to reduce the number of levelers you need and after that look at a configuration where you can control each engine individually. However that will result in some other challenges which we need to fix.\n\nWhether you're a seasoned pilot or new to the flight sim community, this tutorial will help you get the most out of your VelocityOne FlightSystem Yoke. Don't miss out on optimizing your setup and enhancing your flight sim adventures!\n\nIf you want to know how to configure your yoke of the VelocityOne FlightSystem  for a twin-engine aircraft have a look at this video: https://youtu.be/AXdTE-OINDc\n\n00:00 - intro\n00:15 - intro video\n00:25 - creating the new profiles\n01:56 - renaming a profile\n02:31 - adjusting the configuration - 2 levelers: 1 per 2 engines\n03:49 - adjusting the configuration - 4 levelers:  1 per engine\n05:29 - adjusting the controls for the flaps\n06:41 - adjusting the controls for the spoilers\n07:40 - example of using 3 buttons for certain functionality\n09:20 - outro\n\nIf you are looking for steps how to configure the yoke, check this video: \nhttps://youtu.be/Qkdgql7xCww\n\n🔔 Subscribe\n If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP\n\n🔗Other related links\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2024 #FlightSim #FS2024",
