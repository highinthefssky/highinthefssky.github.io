In this challenge you will need to land on a helipad. The heli pad which they selected is based on a recent Red Bull stunt pilot from Poland which landed on the helipad of the Burj Al Arab in Dubai. The helipad is located at the top of the hotel at 728 ft. above see level.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
