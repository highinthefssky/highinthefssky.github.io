  "description": "In this video I will show you how you can manually modify flight plan files created by Flight Simulator 2020.\nWe will start with planning a flight using the build in route planner from Flight Simulator 2020. \nBefore we can use the tool correctly we need to enable some additional options so we see some additional beacons on the map.\nOne thing you will find out when using the tool is that it sometimes makes decision you didn't had in mind. If that is the case save the flight plan and modify it. How? Let me show your in this video.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
