  "description": "In this video we will have a look at FSLTL which is a free tool which allows you to add more realism to MSFS by adding aircrafts with the correct liveries. We will look at how to install the tool directly from the FlyByWire installer and start the tool for the first time. Once installed and configured we will look at the results in MSFS.\n\nIf you want to give the tool a try yourself you can download the FlyByWire installer via the link below:\n\nhttps://flybywiresim.com/ or\n\nhttps://www.fslivetrafficliveries.com/user-guide/\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
