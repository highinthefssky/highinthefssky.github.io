  "description": "In this video I will show you how I approached the Business in the capital landing challenge and landed successfully on the runway. The first try wasn't that bad at all although the decent rate could be improved. The second try was almost perfect from touch down perspective but could improve both from decent rate and ground roll. Keep in mind that this landing challenge is not part of the default MSFS 2020 installation but requires you to have the Landing Challenge Pro software from SoFly.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP🔔 \n\nLive events playlist: https://bit.ly/2Yfagtl\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020 #LandingChallengePro",
