  "description": "Yesterday PMDG released another update for the Douglas DC6 for MSFS 2020. In the release notes it was stated that the volume of the artificial flight engineer (AFE) could be adjusted. I initially started to look in the aircraft but couldn't find the option. After that I discovered where you could adjust the volume and wanted to share it with everybody so you don't have to search for it anymore.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
