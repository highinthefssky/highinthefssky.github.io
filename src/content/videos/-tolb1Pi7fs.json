  "description": "In this video we will have a look at how to calibrate the VelocityOne Flight to use it in FlyByWire's A320. The calibration is required to make sure you can put the throttle lever for each individual engine in the correct position which means: idle, CLB, FLX/MCT and Go/Around. In addition to these positions we will have a look at the reverse mode which can be very useful.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
