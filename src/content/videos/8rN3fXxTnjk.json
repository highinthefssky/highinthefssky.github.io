After this we will do a full review of both the exterior as well as the interior which both received a lot of attention. As last part of the video we will go through the startup procedure and takeoff with the aircraft.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
