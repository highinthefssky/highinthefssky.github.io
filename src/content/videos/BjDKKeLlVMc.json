  "description": "It is almost time for Sim Update 9 and as part of this you need to make a decision: will I leave the beta program or will I wait to be removed. In both cases you need to take some counter measurements to prevent that you need to download 200+ GB due to the fact that in both cases MSFS will be installed from scratch which will empty the packages folder completely.\n\nIn this video I will show you which counter measurements you need to take to prevent this and explain how you can manually leave the beta program if you want.\n\nWARNING: there is currently a known issue where you will loss your flight time if your leave the beta program and install Sim Update 8. It is recommended to wait with leave the beta until the official Sim Update is out which hopefully \"keeps\" the flight time.\n\nThe instructions how to move the packages folder just like being done in this video can be found on the link below:\n\nhttps://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/how-to-change-the-installation-path-of-installed-packages-inc-community-folder/471682\n\nThe Asobo method also shown in this video van be found on the link below:\nhttps://flightsimulator.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015910560-Can-I-choose-or-change-the-installation-path-\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
