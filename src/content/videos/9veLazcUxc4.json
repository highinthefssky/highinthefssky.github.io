  "description": "In this video we will have a look at the 7th beta build of Sim Update 15. Earlier this week Asobo announced that it would delay this update to become GA so another beta build was expected. The majority of the fixes is for the A320 V2. Additionally also some content has been removed but will be added later to MSFS as a separate update.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
