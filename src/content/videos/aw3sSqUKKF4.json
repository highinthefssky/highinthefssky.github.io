  "description": "Can you actually play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on a really slow internet connection which still meets the minimum system requirements? 😱 We put it to the ultimate test!\n\nIn this experiment, we artificially cap our bandwidth to simulate different internet speeds—from a sluggish 10 Mbps to a solid 100 Mbps—to see what breaks and what surprisingly works. We measure everything:\n\n⏱️ Startup Time: Does the sim even launch?\n✈️ Flight Load Time: How long are you stuck on the loading screen?\n🌍 Scenery Quality: Is photogrammetry a blurry mess or is it still flyable?\n\nThe difference between 10, 50, and 100 Mbps might not be what you expect. If you've ever worried your internet isn't good enough for MSFS 2024, you NEED to watch this.\n\nWhat's the slowest internet you've ever tried to run a flight sim on?
