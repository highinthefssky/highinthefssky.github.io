  "description": "Asobo has released Sim Update VII today. You can get the update via the Microsoft Store or using the Xbox app. The update adds multiple aircrafts, airports, photogrammetry cities, tutorials and some other nice things to MSFS 2020. I think it is the largest Sim Update for MSFS 2020 released till now. Besides the additions several fixes are included and beta support for DirectX 12. \n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/3l6fRdL\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
