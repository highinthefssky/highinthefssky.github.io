  "description": "The Airbus Beluga XL A330 700 is a large transport aircraft build by Airbus based on the Airbus A330-200 Freighter airliner. The Beluga is used to move big parts from aircrafts. In this video we look at version 4.1 which still has it's issues as it looks like. But again if you would like to fly a really big aircraft give it a try.\n\nAlthough the release notes mention it works with the A32NX addon for me it didn't work well but that could be due to the fact I am using the A32NX developer version instead of the official release.\n\nIf you want to try the aircraft yourself please download it from the site below:\nhttps://www.msfsaddon.com/2021/02/msfs2020-airbus-belugaxl-a330-700.html\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nAddon spotlight playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
