  "description": "While watching a TV show lately I saw the beautiful nature of Hạ Longbay which are multiple islands which are part of Vietnam.\n\nDuring this sightseeing I will fly over a few pieces of this large bay using Zlin Aviation Shock Ultra. I am using the float model which can land on water but that is not part of this video.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/31twppJ\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
