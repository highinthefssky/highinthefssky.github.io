  "description": "In this video I will show you how I approached the Isafjordur landing challenge and landed successfully on the runway. The first few tries I both landed not in the blue mark and to much to the right. The 3rd and 4th time I improved that piece but there is still some work to do.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP🔔 \n\nLive events playlist: https://bit.ly/2Yfagtl\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
