  "description": "In this video, we will explore City Update VIII, which was released yesterday. Indeed, it was a surprise for me too, as it was scheduled for release on the 22nd, not the 20th. What does the update include? Asobo states it brings eye-popping resolution by combining the latest high-resolution aerial imagery, digital elevation model data, and TIN (triangulated irregular network) surface texturing to render the sights.\n\nSo, go ahead and enjoy flying over the newly updated scenery of Las Vegas.\n\np.s. watch the video if you are not sure how the install it because there is one additional step required.\n\n🔔 If you like this video please consider to subscribe to my channel: https://bit.ly/34eNWDP 🔔 \n\nTutorials playlist: https://bit.ly/32nmUHH\nWebsite: https://highintheflightsimsky.nl\n\n#FlightSimulator2020 #FlightSim #FS2020",
