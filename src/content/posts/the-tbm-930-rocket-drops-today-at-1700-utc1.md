The TBM 930 "Rocket" drops TODAY at 17:00 (UTC+1)! 🛫

We’re moving from the taxiway to the flight levels in today's episode. If you’ve ever struggled to keep the TBM on the centerline during takeoff, or wondered why your engine keeps overheating during the climb, this is the one you can’t miss.

What we’re mastering today:

- The torque roll: How to handle 850HP without ending up in the grass.
- FLC mode: The "pro" way to use the G3000 autopilot for a smooth climb.
- Cruise at FL310: Managing fuel and pressurization at 31,000 feet.

I’ve attached the V-Speed & Climb Profile cheat sheet below. Download it now so you’re ready to fly as soon as the video goes live!

🕒 Global Release Times:

16:00 (UTC+0 / GMT)
17:00 (UTC+1 / Amsterdam)
11:00 (UTC-5 / New York)
08:00 (UTC-8 / Los Angeles)

See you at FL310! ✈️💨
