It’s finally time: MSFS A-Z starts today! ✈️

After the teaser last week, I’m really excited to get this series off the ground. Episode 1 drops later today, marking the official start of our full A-to-Z run through Microsoft Flight Simulator.

Whether you’ve been flying for years or just finished your first tutorial, this series is designed to be a practical, step-by-step guide to mastering the sim.

When: Today at 17:00 UTC+1

What: The very first letter... and the perfect foundation for everything to come.

The Weekly Schedule: 
✅ Tuesday: New Episode drops 
✅ Wednesday: Next topic revealed

I’ve put a lot of work into the structure of these videos to keep them focused and useful. Can’t wait to see what you think of the premiere. See you in the skies! ✈️🔥
