✈️ Episode 5: "E" is for EFB! ✈️

In Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, the simulation doesn't start when the engines roar, it starts in the palm of your hand. Next week, we’re diving deep into the "brain" of the modern cockpit: the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB).

Whether you're exploring the brand-new integrated MSFS 2024 tablet or pushing the legendary FlyByWire A32nx to its limits, mastering these tools is the difference between being a passenger and being a PIC (Pilot in Command). We’re showing you how to bridge the gap between the World Map and the flight deck.

What’s on the flight plan for next Tuesday:


- The MSFS 2024 "OS": A deep dive into the new integrated EFB. We’ll cover the Route Tab, visual Weight & Balance (no more sliders!), and how to manage your Career Mode missions mid-flight.

- FlyByWire flyPadOS 3: Why this remains the gold standard. We’ll walk through SimBrief integration, ground services, and the all-important Performance Calculator for those precise V-speeds.

- The "Dual-Tablet" Strategy: Why you actually need both. Learn which tablet to use for ATC and global planning, and which one to use for aircraft-specific systems and Navigraph charts.

- Pro-Tips for Efficiency: From mapping EFB hotkeys to your joystick to using SimBridge to pull your cockpit tablet onto your physical iPad or phone.

📅 Release date: Tuesday, February 3rd 🕔 Time: 17:00 UTC+1
