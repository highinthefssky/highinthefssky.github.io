Don’t Fly Blind! Master TBM 930 weather radar & VNAV drops TODAY at 17:00 (UTC+1)! ⛈️📡

We are stepping into the "High-Altitude Office" today to master the systems that turn the TBM 930 into a true all-weather machine. If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by a sudden ATC diversion or wondered if you’re actually reading your weather radar correctly, this episode is your new flight manual.

What we’re mastering today:

- GWX 70 Radar: How to "slice" through storms and manage Tilt/Gain so you never fly into a cell by mistake.

- Mid-Air Amendments: The "Direct-To" bezel trick for handling ATC diversions like a seasoned pro.

- VNAV & TOD: No more guessing your descent. We’re setting up the G3000 to capture that perfect 3-degree path automatically.

Plus: Stick around for the "Nice to Know" segment where we look at how the TBM 930 actually beat a record held by the legendary Chuck Yeager.

🕒 Global Release Times: 16:00 (UTC+0 / GMT) 17:00 (UTC+1 / Amsterdam) 11:00 (UTC-5 / New York) 08:00 (UTC-8 / Los Angeles)

Stop being a passenger—start being a manager. See you in the clouds! ✈️⛈️
