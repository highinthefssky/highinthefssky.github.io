✈️ MSFS A‑Z Episode 2: B is for Bearing! ✈️

Our alphabetical journey through Microsoft Flight Simulator continues! Next week, we’re diving into one of the most important pillars of navigation—understanding your Bearings.

If you’ve ever felt "lost" looking at an ADF needle or wondered why your VOR radial doesn't match your heading, this episode is designed to make everything click. We’re moving past the "magenta line" and learning how to truly navigate the cockpit.

What’s on the flight plan for Episode 2:

- The "Big Three": Understanding True, Magnetic, and Relative bearings.
- The math made easy: How to calculate your position without stress.
- VOR mastery: How bearings and radials work together in the sim.

Practical demos: real-world techniques you can use in MSFS immediately.

📅 Release Date: Tuesday, January 13th 🕔 Time: 17:00 UTC+1

Series schedule: 🔄 New MSFS A‑Z episode every Tuesday 📢 Next topic revealed every Wednesday

Get ready to sharpen your navigation fundamentals and make VOR flying feel effortless. Looking forward to seeing you all in the comments next Tuesday!

Blue skies and happy flying! ✈️🔥
