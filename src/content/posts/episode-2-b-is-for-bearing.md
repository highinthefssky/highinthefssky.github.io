Episode 2: "B" is for Bearing! ✈️

We’re keeping the momentum going. After kicking things off last week, it’s time to tackle the letter B.

Navigation can get complicated quickly, so today’s episode is all about "Bearing." We’re stripping away the jargon to show you how to actually use bearings to stay on track, whether you’re flying a Cessna or a 737.

Watch it here at 17:00 UTC+1 tomorrow.

What we’re covering:

- the different types of bearing
- the effect on the instruments using demo's
- useful formula's related to bearing

One letter down, 25 to go. Let's get to work! 🔥
