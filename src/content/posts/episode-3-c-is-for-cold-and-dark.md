Episode 3: "C" is for Cold and Dark! ❄️



We’re keeping the momentum going! We’ve covered Ailerons and Bearings, and now it’s time to tackle the letter C.


Starting an aircraft properly is about more than just pressing a button. Today, we are using the massive Canadair CL-415 to demonstrate the full "Cold and Dark" procedure.

We are going beyond the default checklist (which misses some critical steps!) to show you how to bring this beast to life, from the frozen exterior to the warm hum of the engines.

Watch it here at 17:00 UTC+1 tomorrow.

What we’re covering:

- What does it mean and how can you start cold and dark
- External walkaround (Removing Covers)
- CL-415 cockpit prep (Dark to Light)
- Engine start procedure (The "Warm" Up)
- Plus: A special surprise at the very end! 🎁

Two letters down, 23 to go. Let's get to work! 🔥
