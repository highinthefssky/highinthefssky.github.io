Some fun facts after installing AIRAC cycle 2408 and reimporting it in LittleNavMap:

- 41330 airports (might include some community add-ons)
- 4900 VOR 
- 4215 ILS
- 5110 NDB
- markers 1418
- waypoints 256287
- airspaces 41668

Numbers might be different in your case since it also scans the community folder which contains the Navigraph NavData.
