Episode 4: "D" is for descent planning! 📉

The alphabet challenge continues! We’ve mastered Cold and Dark starts, and now we’re moving on to the letter D.

Ever found yourself at 30,000 feet just 40 miles from the runway? 😱 Planning a descent is the difference between a professional, "butter" landing and a chaotic scramble that ends in a go-around.

Today, we are diving deep into the math and geometry of flight to ensure you never miss your window again. From the "3-to-1" rule to managing the high-speed "energy crisis," we’re showing you how to stay ahead of the airplane every step of the way.

Watch it here at 17:00 UTC+1 tomorrow.

What we’re covering:

- The 3-Degree Glidepath: Why it’s the "Goldilocks" zone for pilots.
- Mental math: Calculating your distance and Vertical Speed using Ground Speed.
- Finding your GS: Locating ground speed in the G1000, A320, and Boeing jets.
- The "10k Gate": A pro trick to bleed speed at 11,000 feet before the 250-knot limit.
- Troubleshooting: What to do when you’re too high or too low.
- Baro Basics: Navigating Transition Altitudes in the US vs. Europe.

Three letters down, 22 to go. Let's get to work! 🔥
