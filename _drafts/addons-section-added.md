A new section has been added to the site "addons". This section contains an overview of community addons for Flight Simulator 2020 which I found based on several sources.
The plan is to keep this list up-to-date and add more addons in the coming weeks.
In addition to this I am planning to perform a weekly posts with the latest additions.

The addons are divided in the following sections


* Airports
* Airstrips
* Sceneries
    * Airport accessories 
    * Buildings
    * Cities
    * Landmarks

Airplanes are not yet on the site but will be added soon.
