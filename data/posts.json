This episode is designed to take you from \"button-masher\" to \"systems-pro,\" showing you exactly how to bring a dead aircraft to life.\n\nWhat’s on the flight plan for Episode 3:\n\n- The Power-Up: Understanding the flow from Battery and APU to full Engine Ignition.\n- The 2024 walkaround: How to use the brand-new walkaround mode to prep your airframe before you even climb inside.\n- Featured aircraft demo: A step-by-step startup guide for the DHC CL-415, including how to manage those massive turboprops.\n- Pro-Tips: How to avoid a \"Hot Start\" and the common mistakes that leave pilots stranded at the gate.\n\n📅 Release date: Tuesday, January 20th 🕔 Time: 17:00 UTC+1\n\nSeries schedule: \n🔄 New MSFS A‑Z episode every Tuesday \n📢 Next topic revealed every Wednesday\n\nStop taking the shortcut and start experiencing the realism of a true flight deck.
