In this video I will show you how you can manually modify flight plan files created by Flight Simulator 2020.
We will start with planning a flight using the build in route planner from Flight Simulator 2020. 
Before we can use the tool correctly we need to enable some additional options so we see some additional beacons on the map.
One thing you will find out when using the tool is that it sometimes makes decision you didn't had in mind. If that is the case save the flight plan and modify it. How? Let me show your in this video.
