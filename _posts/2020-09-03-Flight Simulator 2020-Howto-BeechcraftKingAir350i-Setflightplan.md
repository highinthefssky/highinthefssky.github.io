In this video I will show you how you can manually set the flight plan in a Beechcraft King Air 350i.
Our aircraft is parked at Chicago O'Hara International Airport (ORD) and we want to make a short flight to Chicago Rockford International Airport (KRFD). Before we can configure the flight plan we need to start the electric system. Once that has been done we can continue to punch in the flight plan using the navigation system from our Beechcraft King AIr 350i.
