In this how to we are going to look how we can configure our flight plan manually in our navigation system from our Daher TBM 930. 
Our airplane is parked at Reykjavik (BIRK) airport and we are almost ready to leave. But before that we need to setup our navigation system so it contains the waypoints we use to navigate to fly to our destination Vestmannaeyjar Airport (BIVM). 

Before we can set the flight plan we will have a look at how to power on the airplane. If you are used to a Cessna it will take some time before you might have found the correct buttons, hint look above your head.

Let's get ready and configure the flight plan.
