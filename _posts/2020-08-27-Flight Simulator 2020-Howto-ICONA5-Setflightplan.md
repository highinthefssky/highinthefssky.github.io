In this how to we are going to look how we can configure our flight plan manually in our navigation system from our ICON A5. 

For creating the flight plan we will use https://www.simbrief.com/ which is a site which offers options to create a flight plan once you have created an account.

Route being configure will be from Texel Airport to Eelde Airport.
