A new section has been added to the site "addons". This section contains an overview of community addons for Flight Simulator 2020 which I found based on several sources.
The plan is to keep this list up-to-date and add more addons in the coming weeks.
In addition to this I am planning to perform a weekly posts with the latest additions.

The addons are divided in the following sections


* [Airports](https://highintheflightsimsky.nl/addons/airports/)
* [Airstrips](https://highintheflightsimsky.nl/addons/airstrips/)
* [Sceneries](https://highintheflightsimsky.nl/addons/sceneries/)
    * [Airport accessories](https://highintheflightsimsky.nl/addons/sceneries/airportaccesories/)
    * [Buildings](https://highintheflightsimsky.nl/addons/sceneries/buildings/)
    * [Cities](https://highintheflightsimsky.nl/addons/sceneries/cities//)
    * [Landmarks](https://highintheflightsimsky.nl/addons/sceneries/landmarks/)

Airplanes are not yet on the site but will be added soon.
