In this how to we are going to look how we you can refuel during the bush runs which are part of Flight Simulator 2020.
I think it was in the 5th or 6th leg of the bush trip when the engine of the aircraft suddenly stopped. Once that happened I looked t the fuel meter and saw it was almost empty... At that moment I thought I should have checked the fuel level prior to departing. So a good learning point for next time. Since there was no other airport near me the only way was to safely land  somewhere else, I chose to land near the road. Once landed I went back and looked at the airports I landed before and found one which I could use to land. Now you of course want to know which one? Check the video and you will find out.
